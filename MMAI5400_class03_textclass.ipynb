    "The dataset is called \"Twenty Newsgroups\". Here is the official description, quoted from the [website](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/):\n",
    "\n",
    "The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper \"Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,\" though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will use the built-in dataset loader for 20 newsgroups from scikit-learn. Alternatively, it is possible to download the dataset manually from the website and use the [**`sklearn.datasets.load_files`**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_files.html#sklearn.datasets.load_files) function by pointing it to the 20news-bydate-train sub-folder of the uncompressed archive folder.\n",

    "### Bags of words\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive way to do so is to use a bags of words representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign a fixed integer id to each word occurring in any document of the training set (for instance by building a dictionary from words to integer indices).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each document ```#i```, count the number of occurrences of each word w and store it in ```X[i, j]``` as the value of feature ```#j``` where ```j``` is the index of word ```w``` in the dictionary. **NOTE**: this is different from the slides and book where we organized our term-frequency table by ```[word, document]```.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bags of words representation implies that ```n_features``` is the number of distinct words in the corpus: this number is typically larger than 100,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "If ```n_samples == 10000```, storing ```X``` as a NumPy array of type float32 would require 10000 x 100000 x 4 bytes = **4GB in RAM** which is barely manageable on a standard laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, **most values in ```X``` will be zeros** since for a given document less than a few thousand distinct words will be used. For this reason we say that bags of words are typically **high-dimensional** sparse datasets. We can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero parts of the feature vectors in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```scipy.sparse``` matrices are data structures that do exactly this, and ```scikit-learn``` has built-in support for these structures.\n",
