# Assignment 3 Outline

Assignment 3 is a group assignment focused on aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of restaurant reviews. The task comprises two parts: first, using a custom-trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify dishes mentioned in the reviews, and second, using a pre-trained ABSA model (specifically, pyABSA) to analyze the sentiment expressed about those dishes. The assignment requires writing a function called absa() that takes a list of sentences as input, locates dishes using the NER model, adds tags to indicate dish boundaries, and then passes the tagged reviews to the SentimentClassifier from pyABSA. The function returns a dataframe with review id, dish, sentiment score, and confidence. Grading criteria include adherence to the PEP 8 style guide, bug-free code, and correct dataframe format consistent with reference output. The function will be evaluated on ten unseen reviews.
