# Assignment 2 Outline

Assignment 2 tasks students with building a sentiment classifier for restaurant reviews using Python 3. The provided data is in a CSV format with close to 2000 reviews, where values are tab-separated. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis by training a Bag-of-Words (BoW) text classifier on the review texts, using the rating values as labels. Ratings are binned into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments (coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively). Due to unbalanced ratings, positive ratings need to be dropped to balance the data. After preprocessing, the data is split into training and validation sets, saved as train.csv and valid.csv. The model is trained on the training set, and performance metrics including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix are reported on the validation set. Grading criteria include specific file structure, F1-score conditions, normalized confusion matrix, and above chance performance on an unseen test set.
