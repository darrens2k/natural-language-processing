455,"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list",1,455
254,"Went on a Saturday afternoon and was one of two pairs there which made me sort of second guess but that went away after I tried the gnocchi. Doesn't matter if it's a packed house or you're the only guests if the food holds up. And the food more than holds up. My brunch buddy got the tagliatelle with mushrooms and raved the entire time. Wish there was better bread with something to dip (oils, etc) but that's my only complaint. Portions don't look big but they are quite filling. It ain't cheap though. Well worth it though.",2,254
359,"For such a charming looking restaurant with high ratings, I had big hopes for Nodo. I loved the decor and set up, which I describe as a rustic boho chic. However, the food fell short of expectations and did not taste very authentic at all. I ordered the tradition gnocchi recommend by our server, it was so so. My friend had better luck with the fish. We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps.",1,359
436,"Not from the area but absolutely enjoyed my lunch here! I wish I was able to visit again to try the dinner tapas portion. 

Lunch options weren't a lot, but my lunch set tasted so good! Also the place radiates terrace house vibes...",2,436
275,"5 stars for a wonderful, delicious Italian meal on one of my last nights in Toronto with my fabulous team. 

Our large group of 10 came in a bit earlier than our reservation, so we waited in the lounge area while our table was prepared. The great thing about this is that there is a bar in the lounge, so we were able to have a few glasses of wine while we waited. 

Once our table was ready we were led to a beautiful private room in the back. Our server came over right away, dropped off a round of waters, and started pouring a never-ending supply of wine. He was awesome throughout, always making sure to check in on us, fill up our glasses, and take plates away before the table got too crowded. 

Yes, the wine was delicious, but the food... wow, the food was even better. There were a few appetizers shared throughout the whole table: calamari, burrata, and bread w/ olive oil and balsamic, just to name a few. For mains, my work pals ordered an assortment of pizzas, salads, and pastas. I don't remember everything that was on the table, but I do remember that everything I tried was delicious. For myself, I ordered the tortellini ricotta (spinach tortellini stuffed w/ ricotta & pecorino, topped w/ sage, butter, and parmesan). It. Was. Delicious. Even though I was pretty full by the time my main got to the table, I still finished the whole plate clean, because it was just so good. 

Overall, it was a wonderful evening with my work family. Great food, great drinks, great service, and great company... what else could you want?",2,275
535,"If you have ever craved noodle soup in any shape or form, you have to stop into GB.

There aren't too many choices here -- the majority of the menu is some kind of Lanzhou beef noodle soup. The only differing factors will be the bowl size, type of meat, spice level, and noodle thickness.

The broth is clear, perfectly seasoned, and the right amount of beefiness -- not super salty or thick like you would find in a ramen broth, and also not dark like a pho broth. It's such a good comfort food on a chilly day.

The noodles are hand-pulled, so whichever you choose, it's bound to have the consistency of freshly made noods. For those of you who like more chew in your noodles, opt for wider.",2,535
35,Hands down the most authentic tacos that you can possibly get in Toronto! The shells are made in house out of corn and are really soft and supple. Everything is made with love. Even the way the tacos were served was how they serve it in Mexico - on these colourful frisbees meant to be used as dishes. This place can get super crowded but that is only a testament as to how good their food is.,2,35
134,"Itacate probably serves the best tacos I have ever had in Toronto. From the tortillas - an extremely important, and underrated (in Toronto) part of of the taco, to the salsas, Itacate tacos are exceptional. Particularly the Al Pastor - by far the best I have had in the city (you get a spit and a pineapple! The real deal!)

Certainly come here for the food, and skip the more trendy spots in the city. Itacate is authentic, and delicious.",2,134
639,"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time.",0,639
337,"A Yonge and Eglinton staple. This Italian restaurant is always bursting at the seams with customers and loud laughter. And there's a good reason for that - it is truly delicious. 

While not one of the fancier Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood, this restaurant truly lives up to the hype with their incredibly long selection of menu items and the amazing quality of food. 

My go-to dish is the Bosco pasta. Creamy, filled with a variety of mushrooms, and topped with fresh rosemary. Absolutely to die for. Their gluten free corn pasta has the same consistency as regular pasta and tastes delicious!

I love how the menu breaks up the pasta by the type of sauce it's in. There's nothing worse than having to guess whether the pasta is doused in a cream sauce or simply olive oil. The pastas are broken down into tomato sauce, extra virgin olive oil & garlic, creamy tomato sauce, and cream sauce. 

The menu also boasts a long selection of pizzas! You can opt for the classic Margherita or a speciality pizza (the Elena is to die for). 

If you're coming on the weekend or for dinner, make sure to make reservations.",2,337
486,"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate.",1,486
220,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening.",0,220
404,"Perfect food, perfect atmosphere, we had a great experience in this practically cheff resturant. Prices are also reasonable",2,404
525,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!",0,525
47,"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto.",1,47
161,"Absolutely amazing food. We got 4 things - sopes, enchiladas, guacamole and chips and shrimp tacos. All the items were delicious but the sopes was above and beyond my expectations. We didn't get a chance to try the mole as they were sold out but we will be back to try it. The guacamole and chips was fresh, a great balance of acid and salt and an overall great starter - especially when you have a dish as rich as the shrimp tacos. We also bought two drinks and out of the two, the cucumber lime was a wonderful, refreshing addition to the meal. Both were wonderful though.

The owner is the absolute sweetest person and proudly stands behind every menu item. She patiently described every menu item we asked about in extreme detail to ensure we got exactly what we would love (honestly we'd probably love everything). 10/10 would recommend to anyone.",2,161
463,"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!",1,463
153,"Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking.",1,153
151,"Amazing lunch specials. They have a very good salsa, you will be impressed with the flavors. Really enjoyed it, will be back and definitely recommend.",2,151
215,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future.",1,215
556,"Omg.

This place was so good!

I was dying for some dumplings, so I covinced my friend to come join me here after reading some reviews.

Got here at about 12.30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty empty.

We ordered:

Hot and Sour Soup (small, 4.99)
Pork shrimp and chive dumplings (9.99)
Mixed stir fried veggies (7.99)
Beef rolled pancake (9.99)


The soup was average fare, a bit thick

The dumplings were freaking fantastic. The shrimp inside were cooked perfectly. Some of the best I've had in a really long time and they hit that spot.

The veggies were cooked perfect and fresh.

The beef rolled pancake was phenomenal, but super greasy as expected.

By the time our food came though, the restaurant was super packed so that's a great sign! 

Portions were huge and we had tons to take home. 

I can defo see this becoming my go to spot in Chinatown!",2,556
31,"Best tacos I've ever had in my life. Each of the 3 I tried (pescado, carne asada, pastor) had its own unique flavors and textures. The Pescado is a must try in my opinion. The fried batter on the fish is a perfect compliment to the sauces and often softer texture of tacos.

The guacamole was also excellent. Great for sharing.

The seating area is in the back of the shop, away from the take out section. The staff was very friendly.

Amazing restaurant. I live far but I hope to return one day!",2,31
68,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard.",0,68
363,"First experience: Didn't receive 'regular service' (basic) when dining in, we weren't checked on and had to get up to order another drink and ask for takeaway containers. Tried pizza & rigatoni dish.
Second experience: the following week we ordered the Rigatoni dish (with braised beef) again but for take away there was only  1/4 of the amount of meat so we felt like we paid $15 for noodles and red sauce.",1,363
368,"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it.",0,368
109,"Best Mexican spot hands down in GTA.  
Been to pretty much every spot and the dot compare taste wise and price wise.   
Very authentic very fresh.  
Comparable to the Mexican food I've had in Mexico and while I live veer in NJ.  (The average  Mexican spot in NJ destroys anything in Toronto except this place)

Worth going.   Deserves 5 stars honestly. 




Oh the fried ice cream was legIt fantastic.",2,109
571,"I simply can not rave enough about this place!! Very good price for the amount and quality of food! This is another place that serves crossing the bridge noodles (a boiling hot broth with toppings on the side that you add into the soup to cook/warm up) with unlimited noodle refills.

They have a wide variety of soup bases ranging from original to pickled cabbage to tomato to spicy ones. My personal favourites are the thai curry (not too spicy) and tomato. They are always adding new flavours such as the recent tom yum. Each soup comes with a bowl of rice noodles and 10 toppings with meat. Sometimes the toppings are on rotation but you usually get: a quail egg, corn, black fungas, fish tofu, shrimp, squid/ham/sausage slices, corn, and tofu skin. It is recommended to put in the meat first into the soup to cook it. Most of the toppings are cooked already so it is just reheated in the soup. 

NOTE: When you receive your plate of toppings, you can ask to switch out a few for other ones instead!  

TIP: If you go before 5pm, they have a 'lunch' special where you get a soup combo with an appetizer and a pop for $10.99!! Previously their combo was a cold appetizer instead of their hot ones.

Side Dishes: For their hot ones, the deep fried cuttlefish balls are my absolute favourite. They come in an amazing sauce as well. The takoyaki is not bad but a little bit too doughy for my taste. I tried the fried tofu but its a bit soggy and too saucy. For their cold ones, I like the garlic cucumber or the duck tongue with seaweed salad. 

Service: Fast and attentive. They would usually remind you to order quickly as well especially if you are borderline near the cut off time for the lunch special. 

Overall, YES. Come here and get your noodle fix!",2,571
485,"Good food and unique flavours but found it a bit pricey for whats it worth. Came here on a Sunday evening to a somewhat empty restaurant that filled up slowly throughout the night. Dishes were flavourful but expensive. The portions are also quite small so if you want to fill up, you'll need to spend quite a bit. I may personally struggle a bit with fusion Chinese restaurants as I often find similarily tasty food for significantly cheaper in traditional restaurants. 

Worth a try but I won't be a regular!",1,485
362,"I'm a fan of all Levetto locations. 

Pizza is my signature comfort food, but lately I've been really digging their pastas. This Levetto location delivers to my house (tip of the tiny hat to Uber Eats). Their carbonara is rich, salty and everything you need to give your stomach a warm hug.",2,362
381,"I landed in Toronto on the day it was snowing a lot. It was the beginning of the snow season. After checking into Airbnb, I was looking at nearby places to have a good meal. I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average.",1,381
167,"We had an amazing time here ! Sat in the back at the chefs table which was so fun to watch the action. It was also nice to chat with the chefs. Some people mentioned it was quite warm - they did have some serious fans going on back there but it is warmer than usual. Keep that in mind if you're sensitive to heat but I was very comfortable. I think these reservations go fast so book early if you wish! 

We ordered five dishes: two masa (chicken and mushroom), roasted sun chokes, octopus and chorizo. The real stand out was the octopus, this was incredible. Served with pineapple and squash and a spicy sauce. Chorizo and sun chokes were also absolutely delicious. Both masas were a little more on the plain side and my least favourite of the dishes but still quite tasty. Each dish had absolutely bomb cremas, salsas, and sauces which added more depth. 

Lastly, the service was on point. A little slow at times but it was actually nice because there were so many choices on the menu. What stood out to me was our server pointed out we had ordered quite a lot of food and offered to give us a half portion of the sunchokes. I have never been told I ordered too much at a small plates restaurant so this really impressed me. We opted for no dessert but it was my birthday so the server bought us out dessert anyway which was also a very kind gesture. The dessert was a chocolate sorbet with passion fruit which was quite interesting. 

I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return to try more dishes.",2,167
611,It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.,0,611
465,"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn't: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.


3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!",1,465
385,"We made a last minute reservation here for four on Saturday. The service the food and the ambiance was on point. I had the 8oz prime rib steak with fries. The steak was delicious and cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and had a very nice dip to dip them into. One friend had gnocchi, orecchiette pugliese and there was another pasta dish. I would say the portions for the pasta were small. We ended up having to order arancini for the pasta people to be full. They were delicious.",2,385
233,"Uh I love this place. Super tucked away in a medical office centre, it may be easy to miss.

Service is IMPECCABLE, def à 5* restaurant quality. Very attentive, genuine, and happy. Two of the senior staff came to tend to my date and me, and were very glad to answer some questions about the menu.

The antipasto was BLISS. Lots of prosciutto to make it worth it, veg were very fresh. I loved the tomatoes, they're so lovely they gotta be organic. The owner came to suggest drizzling olive oil over it and he was right! It was phenomenally better, which I thought was already impossible.

I had the prosciutto rosé which was good but def eons away from the antipasto.

What I love is that the price point is excellent. It's my third time here and I def will return!",2,233
272,"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated.",1,272
147,"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto. Small little place and is almost always packed. Everything on the menu is delicious, good portions, but a tad overpriced. What can you expect - leases for restaurants in the Beaches are astronomical.

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line.",1,645

343,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen.",1,343
604,"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary.

498,"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1,498

I eat primarily vegan meals, and I've always been able to tailor my food to suit my needs and even my peanut-allergic friends can eat safely here. It's a little on the pricy side but the dinner portions are big. Be careful if coming during peak lunch (12-1) - you'll need to be early or go late or give yourself 1.5 hours! Super friendly staff as well",2,461
656,"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!",0,656
19,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0,19
145,"It is pretty hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto ( at least veggie) and I'm not talking about the good ole beans and cheese on tortilla! Anyway, this restaurant is NOT in that ""off the hook"" food category. 

Dinner with hubby and child on a Friday evening was alright. This place is pretty small and can accommodate 18-20 people total in the restaurant, sitting is pretty tight. 
Service- mediocre, we had to ask for stuff every time as no one really ""checked in"" on us, excepted once towards the end. 
Price- comparable to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
Food- ""average"", nothing different than other Mexican restaurants around. 
Rating- 2.5-3/5",1,145
427,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from.",1,427
640,"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels. 
The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area.",1,640
198,"It was a good restaurant, the enchiladas were good. The ice cream and dessert were better. Decent prices and service was fast. Nothing stood out to make it great.",1,198
108,"I've been to Mexitaco a couple of times now and they've been good enough. The servers are friendly but not as attentive as I'd like, make sure to really confirm what you've ordered to ensure nothing has been missed and if something doesn't arrive soon, check with your server because it probably wasn't punched in. The atmosphere is fun but small, and busy on weekends, so make reservations if you have a group. 

The nachos with added guacamole is good but don't expect much cheese happening with these, it's mostly tomatoes, onions, and sour cream; the added guacamole really helps, but wish their guacamole was thicker because it's very slurry like.

The elote was not good here. It didn't look or taste like it was actually grilled, plus the mayonnaise and shredded cheese combination grossed me out. I've tried other Mexican style street corn that are much better.

Out of the tacos I've tried, the baja fish is my favourite, followed by the carne asada. I find their tacos are on the drier side so make sure to really use the supplied limes, salsa, and hot sauce provided after you order. I would not recommend the baja calamari taco, it was 3 sad tiny battered calamari rings (like the sad frozen ones) that were also chewy and flavourless. 

The frozen margarita with added Coronita was unexpectedly salty, so I would not recommend. Try their Pina Colada instead - can be a hit or miss.

We've tried other things on the menu that are okay but this is what we will typically order every time and basically what not to order for next time.",1,108
480,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1,480
174,"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre.",1,174
225,"What else can I say but amazing Italian food. I have been there 3 times and never have been disappointed. I have tried various items from the menu and all have been great. Some of my favourites:
Appies: Grilled Eggplant with Ricotta cheese, Grilled King mushroom
Pasta: Anything with lobster!, Spaghetti with meatballs or Ragu

This place is an unassuming friendly little joint that doesn't pretend to be pretentious. The prices are reasonable - A large lobster with pasta for $40?! and the chef is super friendly. As other Yelpers have indicated, this is not a place that will impress you with its decor and ambiance but the food is the star of the show, as it always should be. 

From what I can gather, small talk with the chef and pictures adorned on the walls, the chef (Korean descent?) has been classically trained in Italian cooking from other master Italian chefs. And yes, he has definitely learned well from them!  

Give this place a try. You will not be disappointed. Trust your instincts and trust the yelp rating!",2,225

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Maybe the food here is phenomenal but I wasn't obsessed with my bar experience. Just ok.",1,61
542,"This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro.",1,542

Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back.",1,120

I went after spending a week in the Bahamas and I was really looking forward to some good pasta. Let's get one thing out of the way, service was great - I had at least 3 different servers pouring water, bringing over fresh bread and removing plates. 

Moving on to the Pasta, we ordered 2 pasta dishes. The Cacio e Pepe & the Amatriciana. Now I know authentic pasta is supposed to be served Al Dente but this was taken to a whole other level, almost to a pain where I thought they may have undercooked it. That's what I didn't like, if it was cooked a bit more then I would have enjoyed it a bit more. That's just personal preference though. 

What I liked was the simplicity of the dishes. The Cacio e Pepe was made with sheep's milk cheese and black pepper. Super simple, not too creamy or cheesy - really good. The Amatriciana has chili, tomato and some sort of bacon. Really simple. I actually combined the 2 of them and the Cacio really balanced out the tomato in the Amatriciana. 

We obviously ordered dessert which was a Sticky Toffee Pudding with Ice Cream. It was very rich and sweet. I could only do 1-2 bites, because it was a bit overwhelming for me. 

I would love to check out the cheese cave they have downstairs, and the cute little party room.

522,"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person.",1,522
519,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1,519

STORY TIME:

[A little boy sucking on a post-dinner restaurant lollipop walked in front of our table. He stared at us. My dinner companion engages...]

DC: Hi, can I help you?
Boy: Can you speak chinese?
DC: No.
Boy: I can speak Chinese.
DC: Ok..
Boy: I was born in China.
DC: Oh...how old are you?
Boy: 8.
DC: What are you carrying?
Boy: I'll show you....

[Boy spends 2 full minutes trying to unzip his bag. Then, he pops out a full tuxedo with a little bowtie.]

Boy: I have a performance tomorrow

Me: Do you play the piano?

Boy: HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT??!!!!!!!!


[His sister walks up. Doublefisting lollipops.]

Sister: hELLOOOOO!!

[Mother grabs the girls hand, gives the boy the death stare, and they leave.]

28,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison.",0,28
419,"This restaurant was recently voted as one of the top restaurants in Canada for 2019 - they are actually number 9 on the list. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I love Italian food, so I was really excited to try this place out. 

There were 7 of us at the table, and we discussed the possibility of having the family style meal, which is usually recommended for a party of our size. However, it wasn't easy getting everyone to agree on which dishes to try, so we all ended up ordering our own dishes. A couple of us did share a few bites, so I was able to taste a few more dishes than what I ordered for myself. This is always my favourite way to dine, so you can experience as much of the menu as possible. 

Our server did say that the menu changes with the seasons, which is great since you get the freshest ingredients at their peak. It can also mean that a favourite dish won't always be available, but it's great to try new things. 

I started out with a Negroni cocktail, which was probably the best one I've ever had. Kudos to the bartender, as it was perfection. For a starter, I had the grilled octopus - I was actually hoping it was available as an entrée, as I'd seen photos of it already. Sadly for me, it was just appetizer size. It wasn't as tender as I'd hoped, but it was really flavorful and well-seasoned. For my entrée, I had the branzino, which was served whole. It was difficult to eat because there were so many bones, and it tasted a bit overdone, but still enjoyable. I shared some of my fish with a fellow diner in exchange for a few pieces of his pork chop, which was exceptional. We also shared a side of asparagus as well as the cauliflower, the latter being a bit bland. Their namesake pizza was a big hit, with lots of pistachios and a hint of smoked cheese. 

Four of us ordered desserts, which we shared with each other, and I have to say that the lemon crostata that I ordered was very good, but the Italian custard, called Bonet PIemontese, was the standout for everyone. It's very much like a crème caramel in both appearance and texture. I would definitely order this again. Their coffee was also exceptional, although we did not get it until after we'd all finished our desserts. They really need to improve the timing on that, as most people prefer to have their coffee with their dessert. 

Service was generally quite good, although we did wait quite a while to order our food, and then again had about a 35 minute wait between the appetizers and the entrées. When they brought the bill, they advised us that they were unable to split by seat. This is usually an awkward situation, but it was made even worse by the fact that many of the items on the bill were listed in Italian, so some people were unsure of what they had ordered. It took about 25 minutes just to sort it out. I cannot understand with technology today, why the restaurant cannot split a bill. Their POS system was one of the newest and fanciest ones I've ever seen, so I'm not sure if I believe they can't do it, rather than they choose not to. 

In any case, the food was definitely good enough that I want to return, next time to try the pasta, as not one person in the group ordered any on this visit.",2,419
389,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least.",0,389

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene.",0,80

212,"I'm on a classic Toronto restaurant tour this year, and so Sotto Sotto was a must visit. 

The last time I came here was probably a decade ago and I remember it fondly, but feeling a little out of place because of the prices. This time round, I'm finding the prices still an issue. 

The food is good. A solid 8/10 for Italian. But the place is just old and run down now. The service is great, there's no doubt about it. There's a reason why this restaurant has been around for as long as it has. However, when you spend the amount that you do at this restaurant, there are comparatively better options in Toronto now. So while the price made me feel out of place 10 years ago, now the price makes me feel I can get better value elsewhere.",2,212

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location.",1,70
88,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied.",1,88

I think I may have found my new favourtie Chinese BBQ place.  Again, I have Yelp to thank for this find because you would never find this place otherwise.  Ho Ho Barbeque doesn't face the street so it can be tough to find if you're looking for it in particular.

This place is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's a small place nestled in a plaza at Midland and McNicoll.  The place is super tiny, just enough to fit everything in.  There's 2 chairs and a aisle to sit if you really want, but take out is the way to go.

What stands out immediately is the prices.  Most places now charge close to $10 or more for a pound of BBQ pork.  The price here, $7.50.  You're not comprising quality here for the price too.  The meats here are just as good as anywhere else.  You'll find the prices are about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper across the board for everything you usually find at a Chinese BBQ place.

2 things stand out for me the most here.  First, they have a curry beef brisket.  It's hard to find Chinese BBQ places that to curry beef brisket anymore.  It used to be more frequent but most places have stopped doing it.  You get a large order here for $8.50, that's a win.  

Second, the service her is amazing.  I usually get my BBQ pork a little on the fatty side.  When I placed my order, the butcher took a look and couldn't find any.  Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want and pretend it was still fatty, he honestly told me he didn't have any and asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes for some new ones that would be fatty.  Let me tell you, most places would not do that.  They would of just chose something remotely close to what I wanted and that would be that.  The fact that he was so honest about what he's selling impressed the heck out of me.

The only thing bad I can say about this place is the cash only policy but that's nothing new for these kind of places.

I love Ho Ho Barbeque.  Like I said, it's my new go to for Chinese BBQ and any fan should definitely try this place out as well.",2,653
20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1,20

The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything.

384,"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk.",1,384
462,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food.",1,371

451,"I can see why bang bang is so popular due to their unique flavours. In the summer sometimes I see lineups around the block! 

I got an ice cream sandwich with Totoro and Lychee Rosewater ice cream. Totoro pretty much tastes like taro milk tea! Lychee rosewater had a tang to it which was refreshing as well. I actually would not recommend and ice cream sandwich though; every time you type to eat it like a normal ice cream sandwich, the ice cream will slide out. So it's best to eat the ice cream and cookies separately. I would go with either ice cream in a cup or in an egg waffle instead (this is a meal in itself though!)",2,451
517,"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food.",1,517
561,"This was the best food I've had in Toronto in my entire trip. I came where with my friends on a Friday afternoon and we had the whole place to ourselves for some time which felt pretty good.

We ordered several different types of dumplings, soup, pancake and soy milk, everything was YUM. In fact, we got so carried away by the wonderful items in the menu that we ordered more than we could eat.

It seemed like a family owned place and the staff treated us very well. Despite ordering an enormous amount of food, everything was served quickly and tasted good.

Reducing one star because at the end of a wonderful lunch, they refused to accept credit card even though there was a credit card sign outside. They said that their machine wasn't working but based on other reviews, it seems that they haven't been accepting credit card for a while. We were not from the country and had to go out looking for ATM to get cash. They did say they'll accept US dollar but without the exchange rate conversion which felt like a scam.

Everything else here was wonderful except for the last part about cash only payment.",2,561

338,"3.5/4

I'm a fan! I've been to the location near Vaughan Mills quite a while back. The pastas are very traditional and tasty too. If you have a big appetite you will be satisfied. Price point is a bit on the high side, but it is worth it. 

Came on a long weekend in the afternoon and was seated right away. They have the same menu for lunch as dinner (I believe). 

 They serve bread before the mains (I don't think it was baked in house but still good). It comes with balsamic vinegar and EVOO. 

The mains came out quite promptly. I ordered the spinach and ricotta agnolotti. It was quite tasty. The portion size was pretty filling. My friends were also satisfied with their dishes. 

The ambience was also nice. What would make this place even better would be freshly baked bread, fresh butter, freshly grated Parmesan (small details). 

In all, I'd return every once in a while from some good quality pasta!",2,338
243,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :(",0,243

126,"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!",1,126
428,"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses.",1,428
632,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings.",0,632
587,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.",1,587

I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one.  The only downside is that customer service isnt so great.  Once you place your order, your food will come when dishes are ready.  The waiters will not come check up on you. Ive noticed this when it is a full house of customers.",2,602
286,"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back.",0,286

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited.

When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold.",1,84
526,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business.",0,526

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food.

The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu.

411,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food.",1,189
630,"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5

199,"Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. From the reviews it seemed like this was a hidden gem type of place bit all I found there was mediocre overpriced food and indifferent service.
Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.
Not a negative experience per se but not one that I care to experience again.",1,199
660,"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas.",1,660

296,"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good. 

The atmosphere in this establishment is uptight. The tables are too close together, you feel crammed in. It did not make for a very relaxed evening.",0,296
388,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3.",1,388
89,"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat.",1,89
283,Great spot for really good Italian. My wife loved it here for her birthday. Food was great and service top notch. Worth a try.,2,283
49,"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos. 

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star.",1,49
48,"Tacos are by far one of my favourite things to eat. I love how messy it is, the toppings and the different meats. Tortilla's should be made fresh and in house and the meats have to be tender and juicy. 

I walked into Campechano not really knowing what to expect. It's a small causal taco spot on Adelaide and Portland, I honestly would have walked right past it. We sat in the back on the patio which I really liked. We decided to forgo the usual Guac and Chips starter and go straight for the Tacos. 

Service here is great. Each taco comes out as soon as it's made. I ordered the Carnitas, Chicken Thigh & Bisteca Tacos. The Bisteca was good, I really liked the sauce on top, the tortilla is fresh and definitely made in house - I wish the meat wasn't as chewy as it was but overall I liked it. The chicken thigh was good minus the thigh, there were a few fatty pieces but I ignored that because of the spicy pineapple topping. My favourite taco was the Carnitas. It had a delicious smoky flavour and the meat was perfectly cooked. 

I would definitely come back. 3 tacos cost me 20 buck which in my opinion is not bad.

Angela",2,48
541,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1,541
398,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest.",1,398

The plastic soup spoon was stained from overuse, the condiments were obviously neve really cleaned well everyday. The worst of it though was when we went to pay the bill the lady demanded we add +$2 for tip. I have never been to a restaurant that has said that to me.",1,507
676,"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.",0,676
36,"If there are three words that will get me into almost any dining establishment it is this ""Al Pastor Tacos"".

If nothing else, the value is great! Five tacos for ~$10 CAD is awesome. Maybe it's not that unusual, but a newcomer is allowed a little wiggle room, right?

Anyways, I ordered the Al Pastor Tacos (surprise surprise), and the Jamaica. While the tacos were small, this kept them from falling apart, and 5 was more than enough to fill me up, but not have me loosening my belt. 

The Jamaica kind of reminded me of homemade fruit compote. Not too sweet, and just the right amount of tart. Overall, the flavours were extremely well balanced. Due to the complexity of them, though, I'd say it was borderline refreshing. Though thesis not a bad thing. 

The tacos didn't shy away from their authenticity. Nothing fancy-shmancy, just the traditional protein, onion, cilantro, and the pineapple that comes with Al Pastor. The flavours were well balanced, without too much of one or another flavour. 

However, my gripe is that the pork was rather dry. They did provide two hot sauces, and a lime, and to be fair, they helped, but didn't solve the underlying problem. Furthermore, they lacked anything (this is where sauces and general moisture come in) to help tie the different flavours together.

Speaking of hot sauces: the red one was okay, and rather spicy. The green one though is rather undeveloped. I hate to say it, but it almost tastes like when I tried to make hot sauce by blending jalapeños and vinegar. 

The location has a cool vibe, and the service was very polite.",2,36
38,"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty.",1,38
335,"Wow. Fucking amazing pasta. You can really taste the quality of the ingrédients... it's insane how good it was. 

If you're coming here, come early as the line can grow to at least an hour. There are maybe 5 or 6 tables, so not a whole lot of room. 

I'm waiting to order while watching people make and design the fresh pasta, it is beyond cool. The menu is always changing and I will be back. 

The freshest pasta I've ever had, and again everything was so simple and fresh but so delicious.

214,"It's in yorkville and it has a cool name so it must be good, right? Right! Only, it doesn't get any better than good. Took my sis for her bday and was so shocked at how basic the flavours were. My mom got the four cheese spaghetti-- it was drippy n barely had taste. Mine was 7/10--a chicken dish, sister said her pasta was ""more wet than buttery"". The best part about this place was the beautiful interior and great service. I wish I liked the food more bcoz everyone seemed so nice.",1,214
166,"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. 

The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don't particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that's just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a ""family style"" dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you're basically told that they don't care about timing your food to come out together, so it's suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I'm dining with people I don't know very well.

One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the ""Large Format"" heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I'd also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don't know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. 

We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. 

I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there's not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn't prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. 

At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me. I'd return if I was with other people who wanted to try it, but can't say I'd rush back anytime soon.",1,166
299,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!",1,299
43,"Ordered 5 tacos with a mix of Tinga, Chorizo and Al Pastor. The tacos were shockingly small and costed $10 plus tax. Tinga and Chorizo were meh, kinda lacked flavors. Al Pastor was the most unique one of the 3 with the addition of pineapple. Hot sauces were good, one green and one red. Service was really nice.",1,43
18,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning.",0,18
294,"Yet another fancy Italian restaurant in Yorkville.  Probably fancy but nothing more than fluff, or so i thought.  I must admit i was quite wrong.  Although the cost to dine there is on a steeper side, i find that it was worth it.  
There were plenty of dishes and drinks to choose from.  And on top of that, there were plenty of specials that's off the menu too.  I chose a fish dish from the special (ah hem... doesn't mean cheaper), and i was pleasantly surprised.  The food came in generous portion, and was nicely flavored.  Food presentation was very pretty to look at.  Overall, everyone had the same opinion and enjoyed their food thoroughly.

476,"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan.",2,476

378,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

450,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person.",1,450
539,"Noodles made to order with your meal, that's awesome. It's a very small shop and so I was fortunate to arrive as a seat at the window opened up. This meant that I had my back to the kitchen and didn't get a chance to watch the noodles being prepared. I did get to *hear* them with the occasional loud bang as they were slammed to the table. If loud noises will make you uncomfortable, then get yours to go.

I chose the regular ""Special Lanzhou Beef Noodles"" in the ""large"" size with my noodles as narrow. Yes, you get to choose from super thin to narrow to thick, flat, medium wide and extremely wide. I enjoyed mine and would like to try the super thin next time.

The soup was delicious with a rich broth and the noodles were delicious. Not spicy at all, I added a good sized spoon of chili paste from the condiments at my seat and that kicked up the flavor. Delicious.

No beer here. They do have a number of vegetarian options.

307,"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment.",1,307
438,Great Vietnamese sandwich place. It's not that unhealthy like usual fast food and it's really delicious as well. Got a couple sandwiches when I last visited and both were perfect.,2,438
267,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato.",1,267
511,"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option.",1,511
494,"We decided to check out Chinatown on our first night in Toronto.  We were in search of something authentic that we couldn't find where we live.  There were so many choices that we were having trouble deciding so we did a Yelp search and took a quick look at the reviews.  That led us to this place.  

The restaurant is on the second floor so you will need to look for the stairs beside the sign.  The specials were written on the white boards on the wall.  The regular menu has a ton of choices and some of them I had to look up on the internet.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with questions we had the entrees.  

I ordered the Fried Ho Fun with Beef and Black Bean Sauce.  I've never had a black bean sauce that I didn't like so I knew I would probably like this dish.  I didn't know what Ho Fun was but our server described it as a soft noodle so I decided to step outside my comfort zone and give it a try.  Our server brought a cup of the soup special while our food was being prepared.  I chose a creamy soup with chicken.  It was delicious.  The Ho Fun noodles were very good and the black bean sauce was excellent.  There was too much food for me to finish but I made sure to eat all the beef.  

This was a very enjoyable new food adventure for us.",2,494
497,"Lee Chen is an upscale chinese restaurant in the core of the downtown area. Unlike the more dingy (or more authentic) restaurants on Spadina, Lee Chen is carefully decorated and has more catered service. It is the kind of place you bring your in-laws for family dinners and not your friends after a night out. It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

Expect to find the usual Americanized Chinese dishes here, with flavors that are catered to the general population. Don't expect to find the more 'exotic' dishes or the sharp flavors that Chinese cuisine has to offer.",1,497

652,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1,652

I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,

57,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!",0,57
244,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!",0,244
466,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items.",1,466
297,"Heading out to the ROM for FNL with friends, we wanted some hearty, not to mention tasty, food before our evening out. We were all running a little late, but they held our reservation. I arrived first; our table was at the back and ready. Not a large restaurant as it used to be a home. Classic features and comfortable chairs. So far, so good. 

The rest of our party arrived and our fabulous server was there to take our orders. Another server brought over a complimentary slice of bruschetta while we waited. Mmmmmm. He brought our drinks, a fresh bread basket and went over the specials. They sounded so good, I crumbled and ditched my original choice for the Stuffed Gnocchi with Mushrooms and Sundried Tomatoes in a Rose Sauce($22). My friends ordered Spaghetti Mare Di Mario(seafood in spaghetti for $25), Salisiccia E Quaglia Alla Griglia(4 types of meat for $28) and Bomba Pizza(cheese, green peppers, sausage, onions for $18).  

After the bruschetta and trying to abstain from eating a whole loaf of bread, the food arrived. Hot and smelling amazing. After we were all done taking photos of each other's food, the table fell silent as we dug in. After we all tasted our food, we proceeded to share it. SO good. Healthy portions allowed us to share it without any of us feeling guilty. Everyone agreed my Gnocchi was to die for. The pizza was perfect; thin crust and lots of toppings. The 4 meat dish was polished off. All meats were seasoned perfectly. The seafood pasta had a heap of pasta under those clams! 

We were all so full, dessert wasn't even an option. The wine list was delightful. They offered perfect wines to compliment any meal Fieramosca has to offer.  

Service was excellent. Great timing, didn't abandon us, but didn't bug us. Décor was classic and it didn't feel crowded even though it's a smaller space.  

A great start to the evening! Full and ready to continue our night out!",2,297
580,"They have a few locations across the city, and I would say the quality is consistent. 

The 3 must-get items:

1. Garlic shoot rice with lamb (comes in a bamboo pot)
2. Lamb or chicken noodles (stir-fried)
3. Sizzling eggplant with chicken",2,580
194,"The service was great and the ambiance was nice too. I most definitely will come back for drinks.

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal.",1,194
261,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1,261
22,"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market.",2,22
65,"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend",0,65
264,"The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals.",1,264
433,"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed.",1,433
112,"Great: food, ambiance and the staff's attitude
Could be better: The service 

The food here is excellent. Our favourite was the churros--best I've ever had and large enough to share with 2-3 people. The fajitas and quesadilla were perfect and made with fresh ingredients. Guacamole was tasty, but more creamy rather than chunky. For a drink, I tried the mango mojito and it was delicious, but the alcohol seemed to be light and a double shot would be recommended.

I saw some people share the portions were small and menu items expensive, but need to point out the food here is shareable and ordering multiple items for the table is encouraged. Two tacos (under $10) is pretty filling for an average person, especially if you get an appetizer to share with someone.

The staff is very nice and accommodating, but it did take some time for orders to be taken, food to come, plates be cleared, etc., so expect to take your time while here and not a fast meal.",2,112
25,"Some might this this is crazy, but these tacos are better than Seven Lives. Calm down, I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype either, but this place exceeded every expectation that I could have.

Hacienda is located on College Street, very close to Sneaky Dees, in a bit of a tucked away, inconspicuous location. The interior is fantastic and the atmosphere is authentic.

There are a lot of reviews that knock this place for service, but that's not really the point of this restaurant. It's a family run place where the focus is food and soccer (when it's on) if you need something, you may need to call the serve over yourself, but that's no big deal cocerning the food.

The tacos are the best I've had in the City. At three tacos for $12, it's hard to go wrong. After reading some of the previous reviews, the beef tongue was an obvious choice. I'm not too big in beef personallty, but the meat was so tender and almost melted.

Next was the chorizo taco. It was fantastic. The chorizo wasn't overly salty like in a lot of other Mexican restaurants, which made a huge difference. The flavor was deep and rich, and paired perfectly with the salsa.

Lastly was the carnitas. It's hard to make carnitas as good as Seven Lives, but wow, these were something else. The carnitas were tender, juicy, and perfectly crispy.

The corn tortillas were also made in-house and were fresh and delocious. The servers also bring two sauces to the table - one salsa verde (green salsa) and one hot sauce. Both were great but be careful with the hot sauce, it's a heavy hitter! 

Pro tip: get a Mexican Coke, it's amazing!

Hacienda is the best taco place is the City. Seven Lives is a close second, but Hacienda has them beat in terms of authenticity and flavor.

Put this place on your go-to list, it will it dissapoint.

74,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review.",1,74
192,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.,1,192
304,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver",1,304
0,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.

There are not a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Toronto.
Look no further than this spot for a great meal.

Their ceviche and fish tacos are da bomb..
Margaritas come in a variety of flavors and as a single drink or by the pitcher.

Do not miss the churros as a finish.  They come with multiple dipping sauces and are great!

They have a great patio in the summertime. 
It gets busy too!  

It's located in the Distillery District.  Green P parking right on the site at a fee. 
This area has a lot of cobblestone walkways so leave the high heels at home.",2,155
5,"The menu is simple and the atmosphere has good vibes. Casual but hip decor. And gender neutral bathrooms. Street style tacos, cafeteria style dining, and self service sauce bar.

You order and pay at the front, take your table flag, and they bring the food to you.

We tried the Mexican corn and 3 of their tacos. The Mexican corn had a nice amount of seasoning and a very good presence of lime. Tart and flavourful, with a slight kick. 

The carne asada was my favourite. It has a good flavour and in my opinion embodies the essence of what the standard beef taco should taste like. 

The al pastor had meat which was very juicy, and the pineapple provides a good bit of sweet and tang to help cut through the tortilla. Although the meat was juicy, the taco itself was very dry in the mouth. But a little extra lime, and it was a more enjoyable experience.

The unoriginal had a nice flavour, but it wasn't memorable enough for me to note anything other than ""its chicken, and it tastes pretty good""

Overall a good place for a quick bite or a meetup with a few drinks. If you go, make sure to stock up on extra lime.",2,5
513,"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! 

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!",2,513
316,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal",1,316
641,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1,641
33,"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it.",2,33

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail.",1,520
