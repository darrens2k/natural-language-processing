169,"By far, the best fancy mexicanish food I've ever had! 

We ordered so many dishes - I dont think I can post the names of all the things we ordered! Came here for a birthday dinner and turned out great! The cocktails are mindblowing - theres many new kinds of liquers you can try here! 

The food is amazing! All the food served at quetzal is grilled on Charcoal! Can you imagine the char on that beautiful steak!!!! My mouth waters as I write this review. The menu can be confusing but our server- Brad - so amazing - suggested all the right things! 

 We tried all three desserts on the menu ! I think chocolate one was my least fav! 

Definitely visiting this place again to try the other things on the menu!",2,169
602,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0,602
444,"The food and cocktails were exceptional. Truly. We tried the ahi tuna, beets with labneh, black truffle rice, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, marcona almonds and olives. All delicious and beautiful.  

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein.",1,444
63,"I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure",1,63
593,"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast.",1,593
276,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!",1,276
476,"The restaurant is one of the older ones located in Chinatown. It was packed when I entered the restaurant. The restaurant itself is very limited in its seating, so in order to seat as many people as possible, I noticed the servers placing two different parties at one big table. 

I ordered Beef Tripe Noodle Soup and my sister ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup. The noodle soup are filling in my opinion and definitely worth its value (under $5 without tax!). I tried both noodle soup and I preferred mine over my sister's. The tripe was so soft and chewy. As well, I liked the meat broth taste - a bit less bland. I also ordered the stir fried clams in black bean sauce and they were very delicious. I never thought of the combo of black bean sauce and clams, but they complemented well and a definite must-try if you like clams. I recommend this restaurant- definitely worth the money for their food. 

However, disclaimer is that they ONLY ACCEPT CASH.",2,476
75,"Mi Taco Taqueria is a festive bright takeout/sit down place to grab a couple tacos and a drink. You order at the cashier and they give you a number so that you can seat yourself during the wait. They have a colorful seating area in the back, with interesting lights and banners to envoke a festive charm to the small space.

We ordered the guac and chips, and 6 tacos. The guac is on the small side but tastes fresh with plenty of herbs and bright flavors. Between the 6 tacos that we had, I prefered the carnitas and the sliced beef tacos the most. The flavoring was the most interesting, while the others were okay but at times a little bland. At $5-6 a peice, the tacos are not cheap but it can be expected due to the popular location.",1,75
7,"Great spot if you wanna get some quick tacos or burritos.

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day.",1,7
264,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1,264
669,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1,669
133,"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city.",2,133
491,"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point.",1,491
91,"This place is authentic (in my non mexican opinion) and damn good. I like the creepy washrooms in the basement that add to the ""hole in the wall"" feeling of this restaurant. I think three tacos for 10$ is a good deal. The Mexican sausage and steak were delicious as they had these little pieces of juicy fat. They have different levels of spicy sauces yummm.",2,91
504,"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity",1,504
168,"Mr.H and I were here for a celebratory dinner, right when you walk in this place has a modern and minimalist ambiance, very different from most other mexican restaurants. Like really... I did not see one decorative skull. Lol

I tried two cocktails, the Primaverde and a special for the day called Breakfast in Mexico. Both were amazing!

For food we tried the below:

Tuna Tostada - yummy... the sesame and spice on this really makes it unique.

Seafood cocktail - Mr.H loved it but this was my least favorite dish. I thought it was too tart to enjoy. 

Lamb Masa - One of my favorite from the night, the lamb was so beautifully cooked, extremely delicious. A must try if you love lamb.

Beets - This was ordered from the greens section of the menu and was surprisingly very tasty. The creamy base and seasoning made it a perfect pairing with the grill pork.

Grill Pork - OMG! Served with roasted pineapple and a caramelized onion sauce it was what you'd call ""melts-in-your-mouth"" deliciousness!!! 

I'd heard their meats are amazing so I'm excited to try this place again and maybe have the beef next time. 

The service was perfect and I've certainly added this place to my list of must trys in Toronto.",2,168
478,"If you haven't heard of Swatow or haven't been yet you totally should. While not totally vegan this is another location in Toronto where you can get some Chinese style food that is vegan. The portions are huge and it's very inexpensive for what you get and it will not disappoint your taste buds.

Be prepared to wait a bit to get in. This is a very small place and can be very busy especially during standard meal hours. The staff were friendly and super accommodating to us. They mainly have small tables but there are a few bigger ones. If you have a fairly large group of say more than 5 people you might want to reconsider if you all want to eat at once and sit together. This is great for small groups or even the solo diner. It was actually so busy when we went that we wound up sitting at a bigger table with other diners which was a lot of fun actually. 

No matter the shortcomings of this establishment once you try the food it will all melt away and you'll actually wonder if it even matters. Just go I doubt it you'll walk away without wanting to come back.",2,478
389,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3.",1,389
153,"Excelente!!!!! I had a great experience at Xola, great service and great food. 100% authentic Mexican food and test. We ordered appetizer Trio, the Duck confit tacos and the Arrechera everything was awesome!!! I definitely will come back!",2,153
508,"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!",0,508
596,"Great food for the price. Filling, tasty and fresh, definitely recommend for a quick meal!",2,596
201,"After hearing rave reviews about this place from my brother, who loves food more than I do, we finally had a chance to feast on the delicious tacos from here. For 6 people we ordered a large guacamole, refried beans and 3 orders of the special build your own tacos (king's special, chorizo and beef with onion). 

When you arrive, they bring you unlimited nachos and their three sauces, mild, medium and spicy. The mild was my favourite! I can't really describe it but it has a nice smokey flavour and orange in colour. The medium is a green hot sauce which was equally delicious with a nice kick. The spicy was my least favourite. It was kind of spicy, but flavourless. 

The guacamole was delicious. It was perfectly mashed and not too chunky or too creamy. 

The refried beans were yummy, but really heavy so I didn't have too much of it. 

My favourite of the three meats we tried was the kings special. I loved the mix of all the flavours of beef, chorizo and bacon mixed with onions. Yummmm! The beef with onion and the chorizo were good, but for some reason, saltier than the kings special. Also, all these plates are extremely greasy, so keep that in mind because you won't be able to stop yourself from stuffing your face until you can't breath. It's just that delicious. The only downfall was that I felt really crappy for the next few days. The food here is really heavy and oily and it will be coming out of your pores. 

The service here is great! They're quick and friendly. This has been one of my favourite taco experiences in Toronto thus far!",2,201
38,"Decided to check this out from Yelp recommendations. When I arrived inside the front door, was greeted right away by the super friendly staff. We proceeded in the back for dining in. The menu had a wide assortment of tacos to choose from, a couple drink options and guacamole. I ordered the quesadillas, the shrimp taco, carnitas and fish taco. Overall the taste of each of the tacos were great, loaded with flavor! The quesadillas was more different then your normal quesadillas, it was quite doughy but was oozing with cheese. I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who's looking for some quick tacos and a more quiet atmosphere.",2,38
567,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1,567
46,"Ordered 5 tacos with a mix of Tinga, Chorizo and Al Pastor. The tacos were shockingly small and costed $10 plus tax. Tinga and Chorizo were meh, kinda lacked flavors. Al Pastor was the most unique one of the 3 with the addition of pineapple. Hot sauces were good, one green and one red. Service was really nice.",1,46
300,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!",1,300
281,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice.",1,281
249,"If you are a pasta-lover then you've definitely heard of Sugo! I heard and seen of Sugo plenty on social media and knew this spot definitely belongs on my bucketlist. I stopped by around 1 PM on a Saturday and waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2. It is a small restaurant with very cozy and homey vibes, and surprisingly there was plenty of street parking available along Bloor St around this time. 

I decided to go with the spaghetti and meatballs, and my friend went with the rigatoni with calamari for our appetizer. The calamari was perfectly crispy, and the two sauces provided complimented it very well. The two pasta dishes were pretty good but standard - it wasn't THE BEST we've ever had. The meatball with my spaghetti stood out the most, it was very juicy, tender and flavourful. The food were definitely worth the 20 minutes wait but absolutely not worth 2 hours wait time like some of the other reviews mentioned here. Their generous portion and aesthetics are probably what attracts most of the customers here at first... it is what attracted me, anyway!

The service at Sugo is definitely one of the top. We were always notified with wait times and offered drinks while we waited, and our server explained the menu and how everything worked at their establishment very well. Our food arrived just a bit slow but we were warned of that right after as we ordered so it is no biggie. Although, we felt a bit rushed in the end. My friend and I stopped eating for not even 2 minutes and we were given take out boxes and the bill already LMAO would've been nice if we had some more time to settle in with the food... 

I'd definitely come back for their pasta, but not during their rush hour where wait time is a couple hours. I'd recommend Sugo for a cute lunch date/spot, the best atmosphere for it!!",2,249
234,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.",0,234
660,"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!",1,660
263,"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back.",1,263
419,"This restaurant was recently voted as one of the top restaurants in Canada for 2019 - they are actually number 9 on the list. Anyone who knows me, knows how much I love Italian food, so I was really excited to try this place out. 

There were 7 of us at the table, and we discussed the possibility of having the family style meal, which is usually recommended for a party of our size. However, it wasn't easy getting everyone to agree on which dishes to try, so we all ended up ordering our own dishes. A couple of us did share a few bites, so I was able to taste a few more dishes than what I ordered for myself. This is always my favourite way to dine, so you can experience as much of the menu as possible. 

Our server did say that the menu changes with the seasons, which is great since you get the freshest ingredients at their peak. It can also mean that a favourite dish won't always be available, but it's great to try new things. 

I started out with a Negroni cocktail, which was probably the best one I've ever had. Kudos to the bartender, as it was perfection. For a starter, I had the grilled octopus - I was actually hoping it was available as an entrée, as I'd seen photos of it already. Sadly for me, it was just appetizer size. It wasn't as tender as I'd hoped, but it was really flavorful and well-seasoned. For my entrée, I had the branzino, which was served whole. It was difficult to eat because there were so many bones, and it tasted a bit overdone, but still enjoyable. I shared some of my fish with a fellow diner in exchange for a few pieces of his pork chop, which was exceptional. We also shared a side of asparagus as well as the cauliflower, the latter being a bit bland. Their namesake pizza was a big hit, with lots of pistachios and a hint of smoked cheese. 

Four of us ordered desserts, which we shared with each other, and I have to say that the lemon crostata that I ordered was very good, but the Italian custard, called Bonet PIemontese, was the standout for everyone. It's very much like a crème caramel in both appearance and texture. I would definitely order this again. Their coffee was also exceptional, although we did not get it until after we'd all finished our desserts. They really need to improve the timing on that, as most people prefer to have their coffee with their dessert. 

Service was generally quite good, although we did wait quite a while to order our food, and then again had about a 35 minute wait between the appetizers and the entrées. When they brought the bill, they advised us that they were unable to split by seat. This is usually an awkward situation, but it was made even worse by the fact that many of the items on the bill were listed in Italian, so some people were unsure of what they had ordered. It took about 25 minutes just to sort it out. I cannot understand with technology today, why the restaurant cannot split a bill. Their POS system was one of the newest and fanciest ones I've ever seen, so I'm not sure if I believe they can't do it, rather than they choose not to. 

In any case, the food was definitely good enough that I want to return, next time to try the pasta, as not one person in the group ordered any on this visit.",2,419
429,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1,429
571,"We ordered and ate way too much at this place! We especially enjoyed General Tao's chicken and the braised short ribs. The dumplings, fried tofu and spring rolls were fine - not spectacular but tasty. The place was cute and our service was excellent. The food came out steaming hot!",2,571
635,Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.,0,635
562,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1,562
595,"This place has the best Asian comfort food I've found in dt yet. Their shrimp wanton noodles are great and I've tried their BBQ chicken too, also delicious. The prices are more uptown prices than downtown, so it's cheaper than most food courts nearby. I try to come here every week or so.

Avoid peak times but if you see a long line, it moves fast. It's also open during the weekend which is great.",2,595
61,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!",0,61
466,"Miku is a stylish and upscale sushi spot near the waterfront great for that special occasion. The place's self-proclaimed specialty is aburi sushi or flame grilled sushi which is indeed the highlight of the sushi menu. They offer a sampler of all the types of aburi sushi, which is 2 pieces each of the three different types of aburi sushi. If you're at all a sushi lover I would highly recommend trying them! The rolls are decent as well, although not particular too remarkable. The sashimi was fresh and presented nicely as well.

you're not a sushi lover, in which case I'd probably recommend going to a different style of Japanese restaurant, but luckily some of their entrees, in particular the sablefish is delicious. 

Overall the restaurant is a nice spot for a fancy sushi occasion in an upscale location. The service was good, and the kitchen staff was actually rather accommodating for dietary restrictions and willing to make changes. However I would say that for the price, even for upscale sushi spots in a city like Toronto, you can probably get a more unique and memorable sushi experience elsewhere, which is what keeps me from giving them one more star.",2,466
200,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.,1,200
347,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere.",1,347

On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm.

618,"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning.",1,618
474,"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good
Menu:
General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables",1,474
6,"This place is always packed, and tonight I found out why.

Wilbur is casual; you order your tacos, burritos, or quesadillas at the counter and you find whatever seating you can (you'll most likely have to share a table with strangers). 

However, this is not a Chipotle:

- The prices are definitely higher...
- .... But the quality of food is immeasurably better (we're talking buttery, flaky, crispy fish tacos and a burrito bowl expertly mixed with guac, carne asada and queso fundido all grooving together)
- They have margaritas on tap - and they're actually AWESOME

Don't worry about the line, it moves fast. Just go!",2,6
10,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

398,"Pre-Covid review - 

My partner and I have been wanting to come here since we moved into the neighbourhood a year ago.  We have heard great things from several people and finally decided to come for our anniversary dinner.  

The decor is quaint, yet modern.  We were seated at our table, and our waitress came over to tell us the specials.  We wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on splitting the Arancini, the Caesar salad, one of the pastas (I can't recall now) and the tiramisu.  We devoured every bite.  We were the perfect amount of stuffed at the end of it.  The service was fabulous, and we did not feel rushed at all.  

I really like their menu.  They have a lot of traditional Italian dishes, but add their unique flavour.  I also liked the variety of pastas that they have.",2,398
58,"This was a great gem, worth the drive if you crave some authentic tacos!

I was a bit surprised to find this well run taco joint amongst all Korean restaurants but it really works!

Lots of bench style seating easily fits 4, but gets squishy as this place fills up at lunch time. The service is quick, the food came fast and hot and for tacos, quesadilla, burrito type foods, but our pupusa came after tacos, maybe cuz of table room? Cuz they certainly not a dessert dish. 

The warm corn wraps were so so good, guacamole was fresh and the perfect green and texture. I had to try one fish and one shrimp taco with a squash pupusa(pan fried puffy corn tortilla pancake like thing? served with a pickled cabbage slaw and hot sauce salsa) and was ok full but ordered another shrimp taco just in case 

Easily you can start lunch less than $4, but really takes 3-4 tacos for a good lunch which run closer to $15, they have good combos for certain days which is nice and take out was very popular while we were here. My girlfriends all agreed the fish was best of the tacos, and would easily come back tomorrow after our seminar.",2,58
502,"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible",0,502
12,"Como En Casa is a cheap and cheerful place to get a spicy lunch or supper fix. Recently, I enjoyed a three taco meal with beans and rice. It was filling, tasty and hit the spot. Nothing mind blowing here, but it's delicious no frills Mexican. Bonus points for being on Uber Eats.",2,12
258,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it.",1,258
124,"Went here for ayce tacos Thursdays ($19.95), only available until end of November I believe 

Food (4/5): very good tacos that were way better than I expected for ayce. They were proper really good restaurant quality tacos! I love that they used corn tortillas and were generous with the filling! I tried all taco flavors and recommend the tinga de pollo, chorizo, barbacua and carnitas 

Price (5/5): ayce tacos at this price point is a STEAL. 

Service (3/5): the waiter deserves 5/5, he was super attentive and pleasant throughout the course of our meal. However we waited 45 min to an hour for our first tacos to come out from the kitchen. Tacos came out at a reasonable pace after that but the initial wait was painful.

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0,143

227,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future.",1,227

However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.",0,376
421,"Ok, let's get this out of the way: I have no idea why this is the 9th best restaurant in Canada in 2019, and you'll be massively disappointed if you expect it to be. Checking for expectations though, it's good. We managed to grab an early dinner slot and got:
- Pulpo e Fagioli: The octopus was really tender, you could cut through it easily with the typical blunt table knife. The swipe of salsa verde and the bed of cannellini beans didn't add much flavour though.
- La Giulietta: Their signature pizza was definitely worthy of their name. This will sound weird, but my favourite part was how good the dough was - thin yet not limp, great taste but not distracting to the toppings, held everything together well. Also, never had pistachios on pizza before and thought this was a great.
- Pappardelle al Ragu: The oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, though was let down by the pedestrian tomato sauce and a-bit-too-aldente pasta noodles.
- Fogo Island Cioppino: Kinda like an Italian bouillabaisse. Good flavour, though not enough seafood (cod, mussels, shrimp) for my liking.
- Dessert: Got the Red Fife Tiramisu and Gelato del Giorno, and both were winners. The tiramisu had a nice thick custard that made it a bit different. The seasonal soft serve gelato that day was chamomile, which, drizzled with honey, was just a perfect way to end the meal.

The prices were expectedly high, the place had a nice upscale hip vibe, the servers were tremendous, though the pacing of the meal was a bit too slow for me. Overall, Giulietta provided a good dining experience. Not 9th best, maybe not even 99th best. But there were enough hits to make it a worthwhile try.",2,421
8,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole.",1,8
246,"The wait can be brutal especially on the weekends but their service is quick, attentive and super friendly. 
I really enjoyed their sauces on the pasta (but I wish the pasta was homemade, taste like the ones I get on sale at the grocery store). The tomato burrata was a touch too salty, needed more bread to absorb the salt. Tiramisu was creamy and delicious! Mmm I'll be back!",2,246
9,"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed.",1,9
448,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person.",1,448

That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.",0,362
549,"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too

Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.

Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!",1,549
506,"You definitely come here for the dumplings and not the service. In typical Chinese fashion, the customer service here is nearly nonexistent. As we walked in, a waitress barked ""cash only"". Half way through our meal we were asked ""any more?"" and before we had a moment to discuss, we were given the bill. Finally, before we actually finished our food, a waitress started clearing our table. 

However, with that said, their dumplings are definitely their redeeming quality. They are handmade and fresh, from the wrappers to the fillings. They also offer a good variety; they have chicken, beef, pork, lamb, shrimp, and vegetarian dumplings. It is also a fairly cheap eat and it is easy to share. If you are willing to put up with poor customer service for good food, this is a decent option.",1,506
385,"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk.",1,385
277,"This place is definitely deceiving with all the good reviews. The food is not particularly good and we ordered a great variety of food so we could try a little bit of everything. The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant.",0,277
278,"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions.

I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1,619
331,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry.",0,331

515,"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food.",1,515

If I checked in on yelp every time I have came here for lunch, It would break the internet. The yelp data server would probably be filled with only my check ins lol. Yes, it is that much!

I always order the same thing when I come. Half BBQ pork (cha-siu) and half BBQ Chicken on rice. 

Its gotten to the point where the owner and I just speak telepathically to each other. As soon as he sees me walking towards him, the lady is already preparing my meal lol. 

Their sauce is crack man, I dunno what they put in it, but damn sun, Its mad delicious! Make sure you get some when ordering any bbq rice dish. 

I am a big fan of this place as you can tell. Even Jon Snow would bend the knee if he ate here!

The steak was delicious and cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and had a very nice dip to dip them into. One friend had gnocchi, orecchiette pugliese and there was another pasta dish. I would say the portions for the pasta were small. We ended up having to order arancini for the pasta people to be full. They were delicious.",2,386

174,"So long story short I love it! Like really really really great experience. 
The food is obvs amazing. I love how their menu is set up, and the selection is fantastic. Their twist on some of the traditional Mexcian dishes is very superb. Service was impeccable. Our server was extremely knowledgeable fo all the menu items and food preparation. 
Cocktails are amazing as well. 100% Taste was great. Although a bit too pricy. The wine is overpriced too, which I guess it's typical for this type of restaurant. But that's where you lost the fifth star - overpriced alcohol.",2,174
670,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price.",0,670
507,"Had a day to spend in Toronto and had heard many good things about Chinatown so off I went.  I was in the mood for dumplings and found the reviews to be good.  

Was seated quickly and it was time to eat.  I ordered the pork steamed dumplings and Shanghai noodles and they were good.  I knew that the dumplings were going to be good when I saw them making them in the front window.   

This is a cool little restaurant that is a bit of a hole in the wall but has great food.  Service here was good and the food came out in a timely manner.   The noodles came out first and was surprised but then realized they are making the dumplings fresh in the window.  Good flavor in the noodles with lots of meat.   The dumplings came out and I was surprised with the number in the order.

162,"Updated to a 4 Star. :) Came back for some more tacos and they were very good

This is a tiny and homey place. It's the size of a small room and probably can't house more than 10-12 people but its charm makes up for its size. 

Unfortunately, our server did not understand English but luckily, a kind patron translated for us. Despite the language barrier, we did receive friendly service. Some of the other patrons even asked us how we located this place which is when we got to bring up the awesomeness of Yelp haha. :D 

The food was good but wasn't stand-out. I have had better gobernador tacos and chicken enmoladas elsewhere. I was also a little sad that there wasn't any salsa to put on the tacos so it was missing that spicy kick. However, the warm atmosphere has compelled me to return to try their other interesting dishes like the pressed pork in guajillo and their Mexican brunch. So I'd still be willing to return and who knows, you may expect to see an updated review sometime. :)",2,162

215,"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night.",1,215
594,"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something.",1,594

463,"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53

Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.

Appetizer:
Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling. 

Main / Entree: 
Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco. 

I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items. 

Dessert: 
Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato

The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.

The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. 

Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop",1,463
132,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok.",1,132
60,"Last Saturday, I sampled a number of food items from different food stalls at the Annex Food Hall. I have been on a taco kick since late December 2019. It must have been eating all that Christmas turkey and wanting a change. Naturally, I had to try what El Nahual Tacos had to offer.

I had already had some food from Mean Bao. Although the deal for three tacos for $13 was mighty appealing, I didn't want that much food. Instead, I went with the fish taco, and chips and salsa. Perfect!

The fish is cod in the taco. I'm good with a flaky fish. I waited for a bit for my order. Moments later, my food was ready.

The fish taco was delicious. I love how fresh the fish was. The batter was thin and crispy, which it should be. The taco was perfect and the flavours in the taco were spot on. The chips were hot out of the fryer. The salsa had mild cilantro in it. It was okay, but I was hoping for more of a tomato version of salsa. I still ate it all.

I was with a number of friends that evening. We ended up getting more tacos, and chips with salsa. So much food! I grabbed a pulled beef taco. I give it full marks for tenderness. However, it was super salty for my liking. I remember feeling thirsty afterwards and drinking a ton of water to balance my system out. I then felt bloated... haha!

I'd love to try more tacos here. I have the inclination that the pulled versions of their proteins are heavy on the sodium, so I'll steer away from them. The food is yummy here, despite that minor setback.

82,"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one. 

I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level.",1,82
501,"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings.",1,501
424,"Pai has its fair share of rave reviews, and I have to agree for the most part. I've been 4-5 times before and it's always busy. There is ALWAYS a wait if you're going to walk in. We went on a Saturday night and surprisingly only waited 15 min for a table for 2. I've had to wait for over an hour during previous visits. Pai makes you feel like you're on a street in Thailand, experiencing their vibrant street foods. Service is casual and friendly - they are always super busy so I was satisfied with the level of attention from the wait staff. 

1) squash fritters - a crispy delicious finger food, served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I just found the fritters a little mushy towards the middle, I wish the whole fritter was as crispy as the edges. 
2) pad Thai - excellent!! One of the best pad Thais I've had, super balanced flavours and the medium spicy was perfect for us. 
3) green curry - served in a young coconut, I did not really enjoy this. The curry was watery and the chicken was very dry. The only part I enjoyed was scraping the coconut pulp out of the shell.",2,424

Tried their combo with Chicken chimichanga & enchiladas. Refried beans, rice, salad, and sauce !! Overall the food was flavorful, to make it simple. Portion size was good, in the addition the complimentary nachos was nice.

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food.",1,196

Cappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Servers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta.",1,219

24,"Mexico Lindo is run by a family that is actually from Mexico: son takes the orders (he's a little slow), sweet daughter is at the register and mama runs the kitchen. Everything is cooked up fresh so there's a bit of a wait; the regulars know this so they call in their orders ahead of time. 

Wouldn't recommend eating in when it's cold because the dining room is drafty, best to stand next to their rotating heater (see pic) while you wait for your take out order.

Tried one each of all the tacos with everything on it. There was ground beef, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, fish and steak (they charge extra for the last three); my favorites were definitely the shrimp and the fish. Orders come with complimentary tortilla chips made fresh in house delish! If you are lucky enough to come on a day they make their caramel flan, grab it!!! The flan is dense, rich and utterly sinful. 

Definitely coming back to try their mole sauce, guacamole, calamari, nopales (cactus), pozole sizzling fajitas, deep fried ice cream and sopapillas.

Still on the hunt though for some authentic carne asada, carnitas, lengua (tongue), cabeza (head) and some home made tamales. If you know of any places hit me up!

397,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful!

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.

The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it).",1,283
575,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1,575

It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting.",1,535
667,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods.",1,667
393,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!",1,393
98,Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...,0,98
260,"Enoteca Sociale is famous for their fresh pastas, and now I finally know why. Their SOFT gnocchi was simply divine with tomato, chili and smoked ricotta. Who can say no to smoked ricotta?! I always feel like smoked cheese tastes like meat and it worked so well with the gnocchi. I will definitely be back to try more of their pastas!",2,260
570,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish.",1,570
653,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1,653
220,"This restaurant is a go-to of mine that I can always count on. They serve up tried and true dishes that always taste delicious and are filled with flavour! 

Be aware, wait times can be pretty long at this spot. It is not uncommon to be told that you will have to wait 45 mins at the door. I suggest getting here before the dinner buzz comes in (and I promise it's worth it). The atmosphere is lively, the restaurant is industrial chic, and the service is impeccable. 

As most will note, the mafalde ai funghi is a must try. The truffle cream sauce is to die for. You can't go wrong with this signature dish. Another favourite of mine is the prosciutto e rucola. This pizza is the perfect blend of ingredients. And don't forget to share the burrata as a starter! This creamy delectable cheese will make you feel like you are truly in Italy. 

10/10 spot. Will be coming back again soon.",2,220

157,"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around.",1,157
523,"My family was enticed with the lobster special while we were walking outside Chinatown. The server was very helpful to us when choosing our selection from the HUGE menu. The steamed fish was a great choice & so soft it falls right off the bones. I would've liked the fried squid to be crisper but it was alright. Dry spicy lobster with ground pork was also great. Not a bad stop at all. Not sure what the norm is here but white rice is an extra $1.50 for a VERY small bowl, so be prepared to spend a few more bucks if you want rice with your dish.",2,523
156,"I had a wonderful lunch at Cinco during the Cinco de Mayo gourmet taco special. I arrived just before the lunch crowd and the server was very nice to explain all the specials to me. I ordered both Al pastor (pork) & Marisco (seafood) tacos. Both were very good, packed with flavour and very balanced. Pro tip, try all the different sauce in the back with the tacos. The extra heat makes a big difference.

131,"I don't usually UPDATE a review; Friday was a disaster.
The owners should provide the staff/customers AIR CONDITIONING, they are sweating into the grill it's so hot (flavour to the tacos?).
The time it took to get 2 tacos was LONG.  Poor interior design, cluttered.  1 of 2 tacos went into the trash (very under cooked).  The tables are cluttered in garbage, food scraps.  They make enough money, pay a teenager to clean.  This place needs HELP.
It was one of those experiences where I'll try other spots on St Clair, over Itacate.",0,131
613,"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!",0,613
301,"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good.

What can you expect - leases for restaurants in the Beaches are astronomical.

Cant go wrong with Xola!",2,150
420,"Oh my god. This place was amazing in every aspect. I came here on a Wednesday night with my coworker and we were aware of the positive reviews but this totally exceeded my expectations. It was pretty busy and we didn't have a reservation so we were seated at the bar. I didn't mind, and the service at the bar was actually phenomenal. Very attentive and friendly. They took time to wipe our table between courses and ensured our drinks were never empty.

We shared the polpo e fagiolli (grilled octopus, cannellini beans and salsa verde) and cavolgiore in paedella (cauliflower, sultana raisins, garlic, lemon and parsley) to start. The latter dish is actually a side but we had it as an appetizer. The octopus, which came highly recommended by the staff was cooked to perfection. It has a nice amount of char to it and was very crispy. The cauliflower was good too - an interesting combination with the raisins but it worked!

For the main, I got the reginelle pappardelle (slow cooked oxtail ragu, pangratto, parsley and parmigiano reggiano). It was soo tasty. There was a good amount of oxtail, and the flavours were all there. There was a crispy layer of breadcrumbs and cheese and it added a bit of texture to every bite. Loved this dish so much.

For dessert we shared the lemon crostata (lemon meringue with candied rosemary) and bonet piemontese (italian custard with amaretto, coffee and vanilla). Nothing but good things to say about both of these dishes!",2,420

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo.",1,262
497,"I suppose that the price is expected since it is located on King St. W near all these theatres in the heart of the financial district, but it was still quite pricy for the amount of food that they give.

The size of an order of white rice alone was a third of the typical full round bowl of rice in most other Chinese restaurants yet here it costs $2 simply because how it's presented in small wooden steam baskets.

If you are going for a play nearby like my beau and I were or a financier working nearby or maybe going on a downtown date, then this would be the ideal Asian fusion cuisine you will go to. It is classy enough without being downright expensive.

Location: 4/5

It is right next to the Royal Alexandria Theatre or across from the Roy Thompson Hall, a bit west of St. Andrew's Station. So many things nearby to do and see before or after having a meal here.

Decor/Ambience: 4/5

It is located in the basement and parts of the restaurant is dim, but there are small lights here and there on both the ceiling and on the sides of the wall. They have two huge round tables at the back that when not reserved by a large group of people, singles or pairs of individuals would be sitting around the table during busy hours. Otherwise, they have tables for twos and fours scattered throughout the restaurant and a lovely little enclosed area that can be reserved. Red flowers and red lanterns decorated the space and gave it warmth. Since it's neither too dark or too bright inside, each table felt secluded enough for conversations to mingle and intertwine of the buzzling backdrop.

Food quality: 4.5/5

My Thai green curry shrimp with spaghetti was superb! The flavours were incredibly full bodied. Plenty of veggies especially peppers and red onions and the curry was just amazing! The spaghetti was not enough alone to soak in all of that rich flavour or oozing liquid, so I had to order a 'bowl' of white rice. They gave 7 tiger shrimps that tasted great alone or dipped with the curry.

My beau ordered Szechuan style shrimps and scallops and his was spicier than mine and even bolder in flavours.  
Both styles of shrimps had us smacking our lips and licking the sauce from our fingers. The scallops were sizeable and I definitely enjoyed the meaty texture.

The quality of food is totally there, so I will definitely come back when I am nearby again.

Their menu is quite extensive actually, so I am sure there will be plenty of other food options that I can order for my next meal here before a musical or the likes.

Service: 3.5/5

Pretty standard, but they refilled our water without having to be asked and they served our dishes rather quickly, so we were in and out within 40 minutes, including the time waiting to be seated and getting the bill. Not bad. 

I think most items are meant to be shared, but we are used to having individual dishes each. 

Value: 4/5

Expected price due to the location. Food quality is above average but not the best. I would not say that it tasted all that authentic, but that is again to be expected of Asian fusion restaurant. It certainty has a nice mix of flavours and food options, so my beau and I can certainly see ourselves coming back. Hopefully, we will order something more satisfying though next time that includes rice or more spaghetti, cause $2 for that small amount of rice as photoed made me raise my eyebrows.",2,497

297,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

560,"We came on a Thursday night for dinner. The restaurant is quite small and it is on a basement level, we walked down stairs to get to the front entrance. There were a few tables occupied but many tables still empty so we didn't have to wait.

The restaurant has plain decor and they haven't done much in terms of upgrading furniture and renos, it's quite bare-bones. The menu has a wide selection of various dumplings, buns, and appetizers. To order you write down your menu item number on a piece of paper and give to the waiters. 

We ordered pork steamed dumplings, fried chicken dumplings, fried pork puns, and green onion pancakes. The dumplings were filled nicely with the meat and were quite large. For two people, we ordered more than enough and were very full. I loved the fried pork buns - they were juicy and fried just right at the bottom. I think the food is a little on the expensive side - it averages out to almost $1 per dumpling but for the quality and taste it's worth it. 

Overall a great little family owned shop in Chinatown to get your fill of dumplings. It's generous on the fillings of the dumpling and very flavourful. Yummy indeed!",2,560

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene.",0,83
208,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great .",0,208

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

351,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!",1,351
337,"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!",2,337

If you can get a chance, sit at the chef's table and check out all their menu first hand. Next visit I plan to try the seabream and the steak & leeks...",2,175
275,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato.",1,275
252,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :(",0,252
187,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0,187
80,"If I ever need a quick fix for Taco's I would probably go back. The tacos were small, small amounts of filling but overall the taste was not bad. You get 3 small Tacos for $10 something. I wish they were a bit bigger and there was more topping options. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela",1,80
473,"Love myself some late night greasy Chinese food. A typical visit that will include the fried rice, beef noodles, meat dishes and stir fried veggies.

Their hot and sour soup was a little concerning though. It was more red as opposed to the typical brownish colour. There was no balance between the hot and sour - it was just sour. The only dish I would say to stay away from.

Cash only establishment.",2,473
526,"This restaurant has a very dedicate environment. The bricks on the wall are very beautiful. The food was delivered literally within 8mins after the order placed. The owner is so friendly and considerable. He stopped us for placing more orders because the portion of the food is so large. Moreover,the price is good. Also, they have free delivery when you order more than$30 before tax. Great option when you considering to throw a party.",2,526
78,"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos.",1,78

414,"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location.",0,414
468,"Miku is an excellent fine dining experience. Everything is immaculate from the food to the service. Plates are cleared promptly, utensils are changed and glasses are always full. 
1) The aburi oshi sushi is a must - i love the salmon. Torched salmon and a jalapeno on top make for a perfect bite. If you haven't had torched sushi before, you must! It'll change your perspective on sushi.
2) And the true showstopper is their DESSERTS! I love the valrhona chocolate cake and the matcha opera cake. Whoever their pastry chef is, is a genius. Everything has the right balance in that it's never too sweet and the flavors are so complex. 

Only one star off because the prices are steep, compared to new spots in the city that are popping up serving torched pressed sushi at better prices. I've been to the sister restaurant in Vancouver and quality is very similar. Great for an occasion like an anniversary.",2,468
636,"I was always a bit skeptical when it came to chain Chinese restaurants, but Asian Legend proved me wrong. Unlike many other North American Chinese restaurants that serve greasy, oily, and overly salty food, Asian Legend's dishes are lighter, less oily, and yet they still pack in flavours. The ambience inside is clean, nice, and I like how they give you paper to write down your orders yourself (like in some dim sum places). Portion sizes are just right, and customer service is quite good.

Asian Legend specializes in northern-style Chinese cuisine, with all-day dim sum that includes xiao long bao and other steamed dumplings. The dim sum menu isn't as large as those in other dim sum places, but their dishes are of high quality. Review of some of the items that I've tried:

- Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings: Come in 6 large pieces in a bamboo basket; filled with minced greens and mushrooms - very flavourful.

- Assorted Seafood with Sizzling (Crispy) Rice: They ask if you want the seafood & vegs with sauce to be poured over the crispy rice or not (some people prefer the crispy rice to stay crispy). Delicious dish - the assorted seafood includes shrimps, scallops, calamari, with assorted vegetables (broccoli, carrot, snap peas, shiitake mushrooms).

- Snow Pea Shoots with Garlic: Standard but awesome accompaniment to the other dishes.

- Fried Rice with Diced Fish, Ginger, and Egg White: This caught me by surprise (in a good way) because it's not as oily or greasy as the fried rice in many other Chinese restaurants. It's light, tastes ""healthy"", with a good amount of diced fish, egg whites, small ginger slices, and some vegs.",2,636
292,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it.",0,292
587,"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles 
Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there",1,587
289,"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good.",0,289
70,"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend",0,70
643,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0,643
41,"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty.",1,41
445,"Solid dishes, great atmosphere. I love the concept of family style sharing of the dishes, which were recommended to us.

The best we had which I highly recommend:

-Eggplant kibbeh
-seared cauliflower 
-Spanish octopus
-ME fried chicken
-beef tartare 
- Turkish manti dumplings (the best ever)

Just order a little of everything and you can't go wrong!!",2,445
357,"Heard this joke while I was at Nodo - Why are a lot of Italian men named Tony? Because when they migrated over to the states, they wore name tags To NY.

This is a cute cozy restaurant with great food and service.  I came for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time.  There are many great options on the menu including soup, pizza, calzone, mussels, octopus, rigatoni, and gnocchi.  Complimentary bread was brought out with olive oil after we ordered.  The food took a while to come out, but it was delicious.  

Arancini $9 - These were more like rice cones, crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside.
Pappardelle $19 - This duck ragu ribbon pasta dish was excellent.  The meat was like pulled duck, flavorful and tender.  The sauce went really well without everything.

Street parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  I was able to find a spot across the street when I am for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.

OVERALL: 5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
FOOD: 5/5

this was incredible!!  my first time having mexican food not from a franchise. the portions were huuuge lol, i could probably order one meal for two people. & it tastes wonderful. i was worried everything would be too salty, but it wasn't! yay!

at this time (covid-19), they are offering takeout or delivery. i placed my order through ubereats.

CHIMICHANGA: this was my favourite thing i ordered from them. fried to perfection. i ordered it vegetarian, and it had corn, peppers, zucchini, i don't remember the rest lol. but wow! & it comes with three sauces, i loved it paired with sour cream

QUESADILLA: a bit on the salty side, but that is as expected with the cheese haha. again, ordered it as a veggie, i think same toppings as the chimichanga

SIDES (BEANS, SALAD, RICE): each order came with a all three sides! my favourite side was definitely the salad. it was soooo good haha

CHURROS: oh these were fried to perfection, coated evenly, and the sauces were great!! great sweet to finish off the meal",2,19
628,"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.",1,628
106,"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

Unfortunately the service was pretty bad, and we waited over 15 minutes just to order. Probably won't be returning because of this.",1,106
345,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen.",1,345
496,"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money.",0,496
322,"I've passed by this place so many times but never got to try it until now. The outside looked nothing special but the interior gave off a cozy vibe. The food here is pretty good and the prices are fair.

As with most Italian places, we were given a few pieces of bread drenched in olive oil. I like how this place drenched the bread for you instead of you having to dip it yourself because it helps to reduce food waste. But that's just my 2 cents LOL!

To start, we had the calamari fritte which is a fried calamari (pretty much the first thing I always order from any Italian place LOL). In comparison, I actually like the ones from Fusaro's the most because it tasted less greasy than other places. The outside was crispy but the inside tasted really fresh. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely order this again next time.

For the pastas, I had the Fiorentina while my bf had the Siciliana. The Fiorentina features rigatoni pasta with chicken in a pesto basil sauce. I enjoyed it a lot but actually ended up liking the Siciliana a lot more. The Siciliana is a penne pasta with hot Italian sausage in a tomato sauce. I liked it more because it's more flavourful than the Fiorentina. As a person who prefers more flavourful foods, I was in the mood for something a bit spicy and Siciliana was able to accomplish that. 

I'd definitely come back here again to try the different pastas. I heard pizza here is also good so next time I'll get that!",2,322

454,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

FeiJai Out!",1,454
265,"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...
All in all I was expecting more.",1,265

241,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon.",0,241

When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

269,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",1,269

242,"This cafe is tucked away inside a medical building.  I was skeptical at first when I went in as I was thinking this is probably just another run-of-the-mill cafe that takes advantage of the fact that people are waiting for their doctors or dentists or kids who are at the doctor or dentist and just need something to eat.  Boy was I wrong.

The space is elegant and clean.  Very spacious - tables are set a fairly good distance apart giving you the feel of privacy.  Decor is great and the music is a mixture of classical and, what I assume to be, European pop?  Ambience is definitely 5/5.

Service was great - the servers were kind, asked if it was our first time and explained their menu.  They checked in with us at appropriate frequencies to refill water and ask us how everything was. 5/5.

The food - great food for an unassuming cafe.  The lasagna was delicious and quite a large portion.  The side of greens was fresh and the garlic toast was great.  5/5 for the lasagna.  The prosciutto panini was good - nice crispy bread with delicious prosciutto, slices of tomatoes and lettuce inside - basic but still done well.  A little sad that it doesn't come with anything on the side but oh well - 4/5.

Value - I think this is what brings this place really up.  The lasagna was about $10.50, the panini $7.7 (before tax + tip).  The lasagna is totally worth it at that price point - really should have just gotten two of those.

Overall, quite a hidden spacious cafe that serves delicious food at reasonable prices.",2,242

Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given.",1,320

Another tip: if you want tacos, you need to be there during the first shift (before 9pm, I believe). Otherwise, they only make tortas. They're okay, but not as good as the tacos.
The butcher shop part of the store in the back seems a bit odd -- hardly any stuff in the refrigerator -- but adds to the unique ambience of the place.",2,136
465,"I first found Miku during summerlicious and I must say this is my favourite sushi place in Toronto!! The level of finess and creativity/artistry that goes into Miku's fusion sushi is amazing and honestly better than sushi in Japan. My favourite from Miku is their assorted sushi platter. There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense. 

Ever since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi. The sashimi is also very high quality, tastes fresh and creamy. 

Another hidden gem is their Momo sake (peach wine). I normally hate the taste of alcoholic drinks but I want to buy 10 bottles of this!! It's very very peachy and so delicious if you like sweet fruits and wines. 

My recommended menu is $38 sushi platter and peach wine if you want to try Miku without killing your wallet!!",2,465

481,"Service: Excellent. We were greeted and taken to our table,  where we were offered coat check,  which is a nice touch,  especially in winter!

Our server is a legit sommelier, which made her wine recommendations fantastic and trustworthy.  

Highly recommended reservations for this place.  We had a 6pm reservation and the next party, wasn't coming until 830, which gave us plenty of time to talk and enjoy the food. 

Food: tasty! We ordered the sweet n sour pork hoc , which was soft and easy to eat.  Im not a fan of eating fat,  but this I thoroughly enjoyed.  

We also had the deep fried trout and octopus tacos.  Both very good. 

The desserts however,  I found too sweet.  We had the date cake and chocolate chomparado. 

Food came out quickly which was nice too :)",2,481
123,"La Chingada is located on the north side of Dundas just east of Dovercourt.

It's not often I have the opportunity of going to soft openings of places that aren't officially open yet.  I was searching for a place to grab a quick small bite and have a drink before going to the Stephen Bulger Gallery just down the street.  I didn't find much interesting between Gladstone and Dovercourt so I decided to walk a bit further east and I see ""Mexican street food"".  Hello, harbor in the storm.

So I discovered that La Chingada has only opened 5 days ago and not even officially yet.  Their official opening is this Friday (March 1st).  I really had only about half an hour to order, eat and get to our event so I thought this was a perfect spot.  

I'll admit that I too am spoiled by Mexican food from southern California.  It's a snob thing kind of how my wife scoffs at things like the Olive Garden or Pizza Hut Italian Bistro trying to pass off their cuisine as Italian.  I get it.  People are used to places that serve the best of the best and once they are spoiled it's hard to dial things back to whatever may be available to us.  In this case, La Chingada is not only north of Bloor, north of the US border but also north of the Mexican border as well.  Let me just say that regardless of geography this place serves some of the best tacos I've ever had the opportunity of tasting.

So while I had ordered 6 different tacos this was within 2 visits within 3 hours of each other.  Honestly I wasn't planning on going back so soon but one of my friends that wasn't with my other friend and I the first time wanted to give it a try after I had spoken just going there.

The first visit I had ordered the barbacoa, tinga de pollo, carnitas and chorizo.  The barbacoa and chicken were my friend's order but I had a taste of the barbacoa and the beef was rich and full of flavor.  I loved the compliment of the tangy queso fresca that topped it as well.

My plate consisted of the carnitas and the chorizo.  Chorizo is normally my favorite filling and while it was a solid savory choice I had to give it up to what I thought was the true champion of the evening which was the carnitas.  I loved the bit of crisp to the pulled pork and the meat was very juicy but not wet.  Does that even make sense?  I normally really enjoy  carnitas but these were beyond that. These were without a doubt the best carnitas I've had.  My wife makes carnitas and thankfully, she won't read this review.  It's ok because we'll end up coming here sometime soon and she'll get to try them and I won't need to say anything.  It's sort of the equivalent of watching a movie and my wife saying wow, that actress is so pretty.  Ya, I just won't answer because it's a trap.

The second visit my friend that didn't come the first time ordered the chicharrone.  These weren't the kind of pork rinds you find in a plastic bag at the grocery store chip aisle.  Dang these were huge pieces of rind.  I had to break pieces apart because they were so big.  The rinds came with tomatoes, a green salsa and some guacamole.

For my second round I had ended up ordering the blackened fish and carne asada.  The fish was very good, grilled with a flaky texture.  I forgot to ask what fish they used but it wasn't a strong flavor and a lighter fish.  The carne asada was also very good and very filling.

The portions here seem quite generous but the quality and mix of flavors are all pretty well balanced.  I liked the variety, presentation, flavors and overall quality of the food here.  The tortillas are real deal corn tortillas with a dense integrity.  There's no need to ""double up"" since they aren't thin and won't disintegrate because of the filling.  These tacos although they are quite filled (some filling may fall out) I found kept their shape and they didn't fall apart and weren't awkward.  Being able to pick them up and eat them to me is a huge plus.  If you've been to other places perhaps you'll know what I mean when I say sometimes you just can't do that but here it's all good.

Both times we had the same server and both times she was very friendly and helpful.  I think it was just serendipity coming across La Chingada while looking for a place to eat.  It's not everyday I come across places like this by just walking 2 blocks looking for something.",2,123
539,"This was my first time ever getting hand-pulled noodles. The broth was lovely - reminded me of pho. I ordered the super thin noodles, & it seemed almost over cooked as they were too soft. I suppose this might just be because they're super fresh, so there's no way to make them more al dente. I found because it's hand pulled, the size consistency of the noodles were off. There were thicker noodles mixed in, so it threw me off. This is most likely all PREFERENCE based.. but the beef was GREAT & the flavours of the broth and addition of green onions and cilantro.",1,539
107,"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5.

86,"We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold.",1,86
514,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1,514
486,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!",0,486
458,"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others.

313,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.",0,313
90,"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat.",1,90
609,"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary.

We shared the tiramisu for dessert, but that was also underwhelming and we only ate a quarter of it. The portions are fairly large if that helps.",1,359
520,"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person.",1,520

280,"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated.",1,280
394,"Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back.",1,394
255,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1,255

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be.",0,438

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot..

The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

355,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1,355

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that.",1,662

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1,494

I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow.

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

Cost: 6/5 ---  yes it's worth it

We came to eat with 7 people and 420$, we ordered 25 pounds of lobster, 2 entrees, 1 vegetable, 1 soup, a tray of macaroons!! And 1 bottle of wine (which we switched for 10 cans of pop Cause we didnt drink)

We walked in to it being super full, we booked a reservation at 9:30 on a saturday night, we didnt even find parking lol. We waited another 20 minutes before we could order.

The food was perfect,  25 pounds if lobster stacked in a tower form filled with fries and lettuce it was a sight to see. The meat was great, although not very flavorful the large chunks of lobster made it worth every bite.

The 2 entrees came first, sweet and sour pork fresh hot and crispy, the beefs with vegetables was cooked beautifully medium rare. They made sure to serve it first because god knows we dived into that lobster as quick as can be.

Soup was okay and nothing fancy.

It come with a tray of macaroons!!! How awesome!! Although it didnt taste phenomenal just the worth it price of these makes it so much better.

The service was great, they come very often to change plates, let us stay longer just to chat after they closed and take our pictures, and went out of their way to explain everything!!

I really fell inlove with this place and I can really see how many fans they really have.

You dont need a lot of people to eat there, I see tables of pairs of 2 to families of 10 and more. 

Our bill came to 419$ for 7 people. I would say it was worth every dollar!",2,550
401,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest.",1,401
335,"A hidden gem, that I hope will stay hidden for a little longer until I get my fill. Is that a terrible thing to say? 

With their limited seating and limited hours of operation, you have to plan your visit at Famiglia Baldassare. I decided to trek over on a random Tuesday I was home, a little sick and miserable. 
I got there around 12:10, and all the seats were full, and there was a small group of people waiting for their take out. I got to order right away (one of two pastas on the board) and it was about a 10-15 min for the food.

As I waited, I watched them roll out sheets of pasta, work on dough, and just working in unison in the open kitchen - it was mesmerizing. 
I can't remember what I had, but I attached a picture. I don't think you can go wrong trying every item on their menu - seriously. The pasta was perfectly al dente, lightly sauced and simply delightful!

Writing this is making me want to work late and take a long lunch tomorrow ;)",2,335
612,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again .",0,612
336,"So we had to wait, but I must say it was totally worth it. We ordered 3 of the 4 pastas they had available that day, and we didn't regret it one bit. After waiting about 30-40 minutes, we luckily got a little table right inside to dine in. We could see the chefs freshly making the pasta and cooking our meals at the same time while almost drooling to get it. 
We order the black truffle with tagitelle pasta, the bolonese with tagitelle, and red sauce with spinach and ricotta ravioli. All were just divine, and so worth the wait. Everything from the freshly made pasta, to the flavorful tomato sauce, and the freshly grated truffle was to die for. Ravioli filling and the red sauce was my favorite dish. 
Definitely 10 outta 10.",2,336
348,"This review is for La Focaccia in Eataly. The technique they use to bake their pizza is absolutely divine. The crust is crunchy yet each bite into the pizza is so soft. 

I tried 4 different slices of pizza here and they were all equally amazing so don't even bother following my pizza order and just order what sounds good to you because I promise it'll blow you away.

The pizzas are made fresh and turnover is high (given the long line so the demand is high!). You can see the chefs making the pizza while you wait in line too! 

I'm already thinking about my next visit here and you bet I'll be ordering another slice (or 3) before I head home :)

P.S. You can ask them to reheat your pozza if you're eating it immediately",2,348
205,"Super-nice back patio and friendly service. Artfully made food. My wife and I stumbled by accidentally. We'd already had dinner earlier that night, but the restaurant's pleasant exterior beckoned. 

Before we knew it we were seated on the back patio. 

We each ordered a couple of tacos and they were nicely done. I really enjoyed my Hongos taco. Perfectly rolled and dressed; crispy and well presented on a thin rectangular plate. 

We were going to leave it at that, but the desert really grabbed us. 

So- 10 years ago I fell in love with avocado gelato. It's really good but I've only seen it made at one gelato place that has long been out of business.  Anyhow, my wife was really excited to spot that on the menu, there it was!!! Avocado gelato. Served with churros and sauce.  Yummm.  So good. Highly recommended. 

We'll be back for a proper dinner for sure.  

Check out the back patio while it's still warmish out. (As I write this, it's almost officially Fall). Cheers!",2,205
81,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.",1,81
360,"Freshly made, high quality ingredients. However for me, it was made with too much pepper and it was lacking flavour and creaminess. If an egg yolk was used, I could not taste it. I usually love carbonara, but I would not order this again.",1,360
553,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1,553
344,"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around.",1,344
115,"Great: food, ambiance and the staff's attitude
Could be better: The service 

The food here is excellent. Our favourite was the churros--best I've ever had and large enough to share with 2-3 people. The fajitas and quesadilla were perfect and made with fresh ingredients. Guacamole was tasty, but more creamy rather than chunky. For a drink, I tried the mango mojito and it was delicious, but the alcohol seemed to be light and a double shot would be recommended.

I saw some people share the portions were small and menu items expensive, but need to point out the food here is shareable and ordering multiple items for the table is encouraged. Two tacos (under $10) is pretty filling for an average person, especially if you get an appetizer to share with someone.

The staff is very nice and accommodating, but it did take some time for orders to be taken, food to come, plates be cleared, etc., so expect to take your time while here and not a fast meal.",2,115
248,"This place was really busy on a weekday afternoon (3pm), if you come after 4, there will be a bit of a wait. Customer service is great here, the staff are very friendly. 
I had the giant meatball which was delicious although the sauce it came in was a bit too salty. The spaghetti was good (cooked al dente) and the portion size is huge. The best part of the meal was the tiramisu - it was creamy, decadent and chocolaty, get the tiramisu if you come to Sugo!",1,248
188,"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet.",1,188
566,We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.,0,566
606,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!",0,606
94,"Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience.",0,94
459,"Hits and misses at one of the most popular Thai spots in the GTA. It's legacy will be for ushering in an era of outstanding and competitive Thai cuisine to Toronto... But as it currently stands, it's good but not worth the long waits.

What We Got: Pad Kee Mao (chicken), Chef Top's Massaman Curry (Tofu), Green Curry (chicken), Thai Iced Tea

What We Liked: 
+curry was smooth and solid kick
+Pad Kee Mao was a big standout - definitely one of my favourite dishes ($17)
+Chicken didn't cost extra but beef did 

What We Didn't: 
-Thai Iced Tea was smooth but missing a ""tea"" flavour, especially as the ice slowly melted. 
-Chef's curry is quite sweet - would recommend only to those who want to mix a sweet tooth with an entree. Also very heavy with plenty of potatoes
-very noisy! Hard to have conversation and hear yourself
-spice levels seemed a bit off. I swear the Pad Kee Mao at level 3 seemed to be more mild than the curry at Level 2. Felt like it was the other way around!


What We Recommend
/Pad Kee Mao! Probably will try level 4 spicy next time, but I might stick with 3 just to doubly confirm next time

Next Time...
Will probably try Pad Thai, Khao Soi and some appetizers. But let's be grateful for all these outstanding Thai options nowadays.


3.5, but I'll wait to round up based on subsequent visits!",1,459
130,"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,

Pizza is very good ... wood fired. Friendly casual environment. Good place to visit even if you're not attending a game.",1,383
206,"My boyfriend and I came here on Friday and had a really positive experience. We stopped in after an event and were looking for a yummy meal.

When you first walk in, you'll notice a Mexican flag covering the door and a long narrow area for guests to sit. Our waiter came over and seated us at a table. The restaurant was dimly lit and it created the perfect environment for a date night. 

We asked our waiter which tacos he would recommend with my two food allergies (I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant) and he recommended we try La Tinga and El Nopal. We also ordered two Lime Margaritas. 

La Tinga Taco
La Tinga is a chicken taco served on a soft corn tortilla. We both found this taco a little bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour; we couldn't really taste the chipotle sauce, the red sauce or the flavour of the onions. (If you visit this restaurant I do not recommend you try this dish). 

El Nopal Taco
I was surprised the waiter suggested we try El Nopal taco. It is a vegetarian taco and I didn't expect it to be as good as La Tinga. To our surprise, El Nopal pushed La Tinga out of the water. El Nopal was absolutely fantastic! It is made with a corn tortilla, cactus strips marinated in a green tomatillo sauce, coriander and crispy tortilla bits.

This was my first time trying a cactus dish and I absolutely loved it! The tacos had a lot of flavour and the cactus flesh was the texture of a root vegetable. I honestly don't know how to explain the flavours of this dish but it is definitely something you need to try!

Lime Margaritas:
We ordered two lime Margaritas and really enjoyed them. I was surprised they arrived on the rocks instead of as a slushy (I missed that memo in the menu) but it was prepared really well. The drinks has the perfect tart flavour and they were quite refreshing.

Would I Return to this restaurant???
Absolutely!!  I'd love to try some of their other tacos and I love how they can accommodate different food intolerances.",2,206
74,"I have been here a few years ago and not sure what changed in that time but the service yesterday (Sat - Oct 5) was pretty terrible. If it were only one thing I wouldn't really bother but every aspect left the three of us shaking our heads. 
- even after putting my name down an waiting for an hour, we never got the call that our table is ready. Upon walking in after an hour the hostess checked the iPad and just lead us to the table. No clarification about why we weren't called.
- the table wasn't really cleaned-up or arranged. We had to pick it up and move so my friend could get in and not hit the people sitting on the adjacent table.
- the server didn't show up got more than 10 minutes
- when he finally came to take our order, he only took drink order (we were ready to order the full meal as we had waited over an hour and then 10 mins more for the server). Then after a few more minutes the server came and took our food order. 
- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before.",0,74
243,"Uh I love this place. Super tucked away in a medical office centre, it may be easy to miss.

Service is IMPECCABLE, def à 5* restaurant quality. Very attentive, genuine, and happy. Two of the senior staff came to tend to my date and me, and were very glad to answer some questions about the menu.

The antipasto was BLISS. Lots of prosciutto to make it worth it, veg were very fresh. I loved the tomatoes, they're so lovely they gotta be organic. The owner came to suggest drizzling olive oil over it and he was right! It was phenomenally better, which I thought was already impossible.

I had the prosciutto rosé which was good but def eons away from the antipasto.

What I love is that the price point is excellent. It's my third time here and I def will return!",2,243
167,"We read the good reviews and decided to give it a try this morning. We weren't disappointed. The space is small, cozy and well-appointed. The food was very reasonably priced and excellent. We had the breakfast; the quality and the price were really unbeatable. Superb restaurant.",2,167
479,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1,479
251,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit.",1,251
437,"you have to try kalbi beef, either taco or sandwich or maybe bao (haven't try this yet) it is really good. 
Kimchi poutine is also very very good. 
I feel the sandwich bun is a little bit hard for me, but it's is Vietnamese style  for sure. 
Steam bao is also a good option, very soft bun. 
over all, definitely will  go back whenever i have time and chances.",2,437
151,"Good Eats can be that simple and I love how Xola Mexican Food prepares their food. Fresh ingredients and with a touch of love, herbs and spices, Mexican Food is just that simple.

The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.

We shared: 

Horchata ($3.50)
- I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred
- maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!

Burrito Lamb ($8.95)
- slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour

Fish Taco ($15)
- fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy!
- love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!

Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!",2,151
592,"The wonton is much much better compared to any other ones served in foodcourt. The best part is you can add fish balls for additional cost. If you don't like bak choy you can get broccoli instead.

352,"Eataly is located in the Manulife Centre at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor.  

What at this point most likely takes the largest footprint of this facility, it may have been Ashley before the major renovation.  Eataly Toronto is like Eataly Flatiron approximately fifty thousand square feet.  That's quite a footprint considering this is on multiple levels in an uptown location of Bloor-Yorkville.  For Eataly though you need a large footprint to be able to house multiple food counters, restaurants, full blown grocery options, walls of products and a place for cooking classes.  

For those that don't know Eataly is basically a huge Italian superstore.  This store may not have everything you're looking for that is Italian in that they don't have Ferarri or Lamborghini for sale but they do have prosciutto from Modena and many other places for that matter.  Looking for Grana Padano or Reggio Parmigiana?  Will a wheel do?  The guy working the cheese counter said somebody came in and bought half a wheel cut lengthwise for a wedding just the other day.  

While the place doesn't have Santa Maria Novella like the NYC Flatiron store they do have on premise made beer at the birroteca on the concourse level.  Using Italian hops and other ingredients Eataly Toronto has the only on premise brewery of all the Eataly establishments so that's sort of special.

I had out of town guests and while my wife has been to Eataly Toronto already I had not been so my first visit was going to be with the out of towners.  We spent quite a bit of time at the olive oil wall as they were trying samples and deciding which to get.  My wife picked one she knew she wanted without trying any samples.  My friends tried a variety and eventually bought one and also a bottle of balsamic to go with it.  My friends ended up getting fresh ravioli nearby as well.

It was mid afternoon on a Friday and the pasta and Neapolitan pizza restaurants had some seating but we were already going to eat a few hours later at a place we made reservations for earlier in the day.  I noticed the Roman style pizza bar was quite popular and a quicker option.  I had the Roman pizza in the Eataly in Century City and I prefer it to the Neapolitan actually.  I like the crunch and the variety of slices I can get in one sitting and while Neapolitan doesn't take very long to make the Roman slices are ready.

Overall Eataly is overwhelming.  While I've been to 3 others (NYC - Flatiron, Chicago, LA - Century City) I found Toronto's to be as good as at least Flatiron but less streamlined.  Toronto's version is more like an Ikea gauntlet that makes you go through the entire store to say get to the gelato bar.  At Flatiron and Chicago the Lavazza and gelato can be accessed at the first floor level without having to go all the way in.  The Toronto setup has the café type areas in the area on the upper level facing Bloor where there's the pasta/pizza area, bar, coffee/dessert stand, Roman pizza all in a corner.

The content of Eataly Toronto is basically all there in an unfamiliar footprint albeit still somewhat organized.  I like this concept and I'll be back to try the other offerings like the pizza and pasta.",2,352

Service - fast and accurate. 10/10

Interior - super packed. Very hard to actually get a table. But cute layout! 5/10

I ate at this place three times while on a 5 day trip to Toronto, which simply speaks to how good this place was! I'm convinced this place is packed regardless of the time of day.

85,"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about.

It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

522,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

The patio is super cute and great for just chilling with friends and having some yummy cocktails. Loved the vast tequila selection as well!",2,108
647,I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here,0,647
250,"Lets just say... it's defs the worth! When we first got there on a tuesday night we honestly didn't think it was that busy, since there was only a few people outside waiting. Oh man, we were wrong! When we inside to put our name on the list, ends up there was a 3 page waiting list & almost a 2 hour wait (currently 7:30ish). We went out for a bit then, realized they did take out. So instead of waiting the 2 hours, we ended up waiting 30mins & sat across the street on the bench - and well, though it wasn't ideal the food defs made up for it! Also, everything was fairly priced!! 

We got the mozzarella sticks, meatballs, pepper poppers, calamari & half pasta and half salad - and none of the food disappointed!! The mozzarella sticks had the cheesy pull, meatballs were soft and the sauce went perfect with it. As for the calamari, it was soft and perfectly salted!! The pasta and salad - if you get together you save $3, both were delicious and i would say probably one of my favourite caesar salads. 

Though we didn't get a chance to dine in, we were really impressed with the food and we would defs come back!!",2,250
54,"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet.",1,54
232,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening.",0,232
15,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing. Go look at the photo and tell me if that's worth it. At least try a little.",0,15
145,"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown.",0,145
475,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1,475
447,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours.

380,"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

Love the drink list: wine, beer, cocktails. A great place to have a drink with snacks. 

We seated by the bar area, so one of the bartenders was serving us. We were checked on frequently and the service was attentive.

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area.",1,380
259,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service.",1,259
49,"Campechano is a great place for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Their menu contains options for both and items are sold by piece, so everyone can order whatever they want.

Most tables start with the guacamole ($8) where it arrives with two cups brimming with thin crispy chips, which they refill if you finish the tortilla before the dips. The salsa roja is great, with just a bit of spice and plenty of zest. It leaves the guacamole feeling fairly neutral, jazzed up with pomegranate - an interesting twist, though personally I do enjoy my dip without fruit.

If you're feeling hungry than order a sencillo sopes ($6) for yourself; otherwise, it's hearty enough to share. The tortilla is thicker and soft, almost like naan but not oily. A layer of refried beans is spread on top with lettuce, cheese, and two types of sauce covering the pillowy tortilla. A different alternative to Campechano's tacos, but not nearly as exciting.

If you can handle spice, the hongo ahumado ($6) has a healthy kick of fiery sauce drizzled on top. This heat was unexpected as the taco's description made it sound earthy tasting, from the smoked mushroom base, with a hearty finish, thanks to the white bean puree. In reality, aside from the spice, it's rather fresh with plenty of herbs sprinkled over top and very tasty, despite all the water you'll have afterwards.

On the other hand, the healthy sprinkling of cotija cheese on the rajas ($5) makes the roasted poblano peppers taco richer than you'd expect. Additionally, the peppers aren't spicy at all, instead having a deep earthiness. With little bits of corn added for bite, this was another tasty taco.

Campechano's dining room is small and cozy, so try to make a reservation. Regardless, there seems to be plenty of walk-ins and on our weekday dinner visit, the wait wasn't long... their service is friendly and efficient so most tables turn over quickly.",2,49
135,"I ordered suadero (beef) tacos. I didn't have high expectations because I've eaten real tacos in Mexico City and it's hard to match that authentic taste.
These tacos were loaded with beef. Very filling. I was worried that I'd still be hungry, but they use the large tortillas and they were loaded. 
I'm happy to say that they were quite delicious. Even my wife who is Mexican really enjoyed the food here. And she's hard to please when it comes to Mexican food. 
I had one of my wife's al pastor tacos and it was soooo flavourful. I highly recommend this one as well. 
The hot sauce was nice and hot too if you like your food spicy. 
My only knock, was that the service was a bit slow. Other then that, this place is the real deal.",2,135
626,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0,626
316,"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5.",1,316
339,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre.",1,339
29,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back.",1,29
579,"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships.",0,579
572,"What I got: Eggplant with beef ($14), Chili fish ($15), Pan fried pork and chive dumplings ($9), Green Onion pancake ($5), Ginger Beef ($13), Fried Vermicelli ($13)

Pros:
- Great restaurant to check out if you want greasy hangover food without it being the boring burger and fries that you see at the nearby patios. 
- All the items on the menu are under $15 and all dumplings are under $10, if you go with a big group, you can try several items for cheap. 
- My favourite items are the Chili fish and eggplant, they were very flavourful, not too spicy and goes great with rice. Other popular items people got were the sweet and sour pork and fries green beans. 
- They have a great patio however the wait time can be quite long and there is not as much seating inside. We went as a group of 7 and they were nice enough to accommodate even without a reservation 
- Good selection of vegetarian food. 
- They give white rabbit candy at the end when you pay the bill. 
- I also saw that they do delivery and it seems quite popular as foodora bikers were coming in and out frequently. 

Cons:
- Compared to the classic Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, the portions are smaller for almost the same price. However I would say this place is probably cleaner and has a more hip vibe. 
- One star taken off only because the scallion pancake was quite burnt, when we ordered a second, it came out golden with a soft center and crunchy exterior like it should be so it was probably just a one-time issue.",2,572
113,"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh.",1,113

138,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited.

You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be.",0,597

I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet.

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

422,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal.",1,422

332,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

253,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end.

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

My boyfriend actually recommended this place after seeing a friend posted a Snapchat story about these amazing rose mangos! 

When we arrived we were so fascinated with all the Mexican the decour, it was absolutely authentic. We just ordered the rose mangos so I can't comment on the actual food like the tacos and burritos that they also sell. 

The rose mangos were really delicious but quite messy to eat it's not something that you can walk around and eat. You have to sit down and enjoy it. 

Ps: make sure you grab a lot of napkins while eating this.",2,101
319,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal",1,319
68,"I came here with 3 friends on a Saturday afternoon. It was surprisingly NOT busy at all.. maybe 2 other tables were seated? I was surprised because I heard great reviews about this place.

The service was a slow (oddly), but the food was good. The only thing I didn't care for were the chips. They were so hard and crunchy, it felt like I was cutting my gums with every bite.",2,68
31,"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill.",0,31
611,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning.",0,611
236,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.",1,236
426,"Food: A very popular place in downtown for thai food and it definitely did not disappoint me at all! I did not order pad thai (what I usually stick with) because I was trying to be more adventurous and I was very glad with my food choices! I highly recommend the pork rice with egg as it was the best out of three. Im guessing the pork was marinated with a lot of different ingredients and so with the fish sauce and lime juices, there was a burst of different flavours going on in a single bite. The chicken wings were amazing as well but nothing too surprising. The curry noodle was very interesting as I did not expect them to use egg noodle, the beef brisket was too hard though. I did still enjoy the coconut heavy flavoured curry overall. 

Portion: Normal to small

Environment: I was put to sit at a high table and the only issue was that there was no where to hang my winter jacket. Other than that the vibe of the restaurant was really nice with all the decors!",2,426
88,"La Carnita is one hip taco joint in the heart of the downtown core. We were a party of five on a Friday night so we had reserved our seats in advance. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and really gave us useful insights and advice of what to order.

We ordered the tortilla chips with all three dips to give some variety to our table. The corn salsa was my absolute favourite. They were all quite delicious though. The corn salsa stood out because it was sweet, tangy, and aromatic. It just paired so finely with the chips. Next, we started ordering our tacos.

As per recommended by our server, I got the In Cod We Trust and the Pollo Frito tacos to start. Each tacos was about the size of your hand and was loaded with a sizeable protein and veggie. The Pollo Frito stood out for me because of its slight crunch and exploding flavour from the peanut lime sauce. The cod taco was an interesting combination. I liked the flaky texture of the fish and the fresh vegetables. These tacos really impressed me so I ordered the Carne Asada taco to finish. The steak had an intoxicating smoky flavour which I really liked. 

I had to grab some churros in the end to really tie my meal together. They gave me 3 huge churros along with a sweet dip. Really loved the crispy exterior and tender centre.

Super happy I tried this place out. It is such a great place to dine in on a casual outing!",2,88
134,"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos.",1,134
538,"I was craving for noodle so we saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We came at lunch time and there were a lot of people in the line  15-20 people, but the line move really quick so we ended up wait around 15'. Why I was waiting in line, I got to watch the people inside hand made the noodle, that was so awesome and how much work that put in to have a yummy bowl of noodle. We decided to try the big bowl of beef noodle. The noodle is really good, we chose the thick noodle and not so chewy. The soup was tasty and add a little bit spicy to it, it was so good.",2,538
537,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1,537
333,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards.",0,333
648,"Small, cold (in the winter!), drabby looking, and to be honest, a little pricier than average... And yet there's a good reason they feature a line up every time: amazing Chinese barbeque style meat.

What We Got: roast pork, duck wings and duck feet
What We Liked: all of it.
What We Didn't: the lack of heat during long winter line ups...!
What We'll Get Next: they've got curry beef brisket for $10 and I have to try that. Plus more roast pork.
Also got some solid lunch specials.

YOU SHOULD BRING A FRIEND WHO SPEAKS CANTONESE OR READS CHINESE. Tucked away on the southeast side of Midland and Mcnicoll, it's easy to miss. And when you get into the plaza, it's also easy to miss because it's rather  unadorned, and sits next to another Chinese barbeque spot.

Anyway, once you get in.... this is the ultimate NO DECOR, NO FANCY STUFF, NO FRILLS (actually moreso than the grocery store), OG style Chinese barbeque place.

All the signs are in Chinese and they're taped up in random places. They ain't here to look pretty. There will probably be a line up of grannies and grampies and uncles and aunties... And that's when you know the people KNOW. This is good barbeque.

Fast and efficient service.

Cuts of meat were soooo crunchy, tender, delicious.

You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.

We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. 

Service over Food here!",1,240

 BBQ Pork, Roast Pork ( Crispy Pork), Soya Chicken and Roast duck.
Pick any meat of a bed of white rice and blanched Chinese vegetables. Yum, right?  YES!

We had a little hard time communicating since my Chinese was so rusty but thanks to previous yelp pics, we were able to get what we wanted. The employees had great customer service as well.Even though, the store opens at 11am, they open at 10:30am and we saw some lines already. 

We got the lunches or platters and it came with a drink for CAD 6.50 per box. My husband and I looked at each other and we were like, that couldn't be right! We saw how much food we were getting and also the drinks too!! No way, but yes we did..

Great customer service+ ample & tasty food+ Affordability= One Very Happy Customer

What we did, we got the food and went to a park to eat. :D",2,650

There were plenty of good reviews on Yelp so we decided to give it a chance. Things started to look up after the chef/owner finally came out of the kitchen. The restaurants decor is quirky and if you dont care about aesthetics, I think you will enjoy this restaurant. The Korean man knows his Italian food. His entertaining stories are a bonus.",2,239

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal.",1,204

I would come back, but for sure consult with your server to ask about how much kick is in the food!",2,105

And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1,146
446,"Amazing food and amazing experience. Our server was very helpful. We thought the portion sizes were going to be small so we were going to order too much but he helped us out a lot.

We started with the manti dumplings and the truffle pidhe which were both amazing. I'm still drooling at the thought of the mushrooms. Definitely a must try! Then we got the brussel sprouts and the lamb for two. Both were amazing. The sprouts came with halloumi cheese. The lamb came on a tray with toppings to build your own wraps. It was so much food we got some to go 

We also got the tea service and ordered mint tea. It came with Turkish delight as appertiffs. It was amazing! The more we drank it the hungrier we got.

We were too full for a dessert so we just got saffron ice cream and Turkish coffee. Both were amazing. Such a great meal.",2,446
65,"3.5 stars!

I came here for a pitcher of sangria while I waited for DaiLo to open for dinner service. The staff wasn't the most welcoming and the sangria tasted like straight-up soda. I can't really speak to the food since I wasn't planning on dining here but people poured in right at opening time so that must be a good sign. 

Maybe the food here is phenomenal but I wasn't obsessed with my bar experience. Just ok.",1,65
484,"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate.",1,484

21,"I have driven by this plaza several times, yet I never noticed this small Mexican restaurant until a friend suggested it.

There are only a handful of tables and I noticed they do a lot of take-out orders.  The menus are on chalkboards so it is very easy to read.  We ordered at the cash register, and then found a seat.  We were given complimentary tortilla chips and homemade salsa, which was a nice start.  We ordered two of the Mexican Combos, which consists of one beef chimichanga, one chicken enchilada, rice, salad and beans.  The food was very authentic and fresh.  I thought the beef would have been chunks rather than ground beef though.  My bad for not asking.  

The real star of the meal for me was the horchata.  I have not had once since our vacation in Mexico.  The drink was refreshing, delicious, and very creamy, with the right balance of rice, almonds, various milks and cinnamon.  It is very filling though!  I would definitely order it again.  

I was beyond full, but being a dessert lover, I had to try the caramel flan.  I should have taken it to go, but it looked so delicious.  Mexico Lindo's version is quite different.  The flan is very firm, not jiggly wiggly, and big on flavor!  My husband had only one bite, which is just as well.  I managed to finish it all by myself.

The owner came over and chatted with us, and it is nice to see a family put so much passion into what they do.  

Mexican Combo - $11.95
Horachata - $3.50
Caramel Flan - $6.00",2,21

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!",1,96
76,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town.",1,76

172,"I had high expectations for this restaurant based on other reviews but for me, it ended up being just an average meal. 

The restaurant itself is very nice inside. The decor is unique and the feel of the restaurant is upscale yet welcoming. Staff are very friendly and professional. I don't particularly enjoy the high seats we had, but that's just me. The menu is a bit confusing so we had a lot of questions, and our server was happy to explain. There were four of us dining and we had intended on ordering our own food, but apparently this restaurant suggests more of a ""family style"" dining experience. I feel that this is a lazy way of serving, as you're basically told that they don't care about timing your food to come out together, so it's suggested you share whatever comes out first. Not my favourite way to eat when I'm dining with people I don't know very well.

One of the guys at our table wanted to order a drink that was under the ""Large Format"" heading, which our server explained was meant to share. She also said it could be served as a single drink if he wanted. I read the description (Velvet Krush) and decided I'd also like to try it. When our drinks were brought out, it was served as a single drink with two straws. I don't know what made her think that two people sitting on opposite ends of the table from each other would want to share a drink like that, but we sent it back requesting two separate glasses. Even if we had been a couple, I would not want to share a drink like that. Very strange. At least the drink was really good. Something I would definitely have again. 

We ordered a few ceviche dishes to start. Most of the dishes were good, but at this price point, I honestly expected to be wowed at least with some of the dishes. The presentation was exceptional, which is probably why I was disappointed, as I expected everything to taste as good as it looked. I did enjoy the scallop ceviche - probably my favourite dish of all the ones I tried. 

I had the hanger steak as my main with a side of grilled mushrooms. The steak was cooked rare, which I found to be a bit rubbery. Had it been cooked a bit more to mid-rare, it probably would have been perfect. Because they sliced the steak before bringing to the table, there's not much you can do to salvage it, aside from ordering a new one. Given the two-hour window they impose, I wasn't prepared to chance it, as we were over 2/3 of our time already. The mushrooms also looked better than they tasted, as I felt the broth kind of watered down the mushroom flavour rather than enhancing it. I also tasted the grilled fish and the coal roasted sweet potato, but neither was to my liking. It seemed like the char from the grill kind of overpowered everything else. 

At the end of the meal, there was nothing really outstanding for me. I'd return if I was with other people who wanted to try it, but can't say I'd rush back anytime soon.",1,172
372,"Amazing gem in the yonge and eglinton neighborhood serving out the best al dente pasta. I ordered their beef brisket ravioli pasta and it was out of this world!

574,"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying.",1,574

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian.",1,323

Freshly fried, crispy and mildly spicy, the fish was was topped with chipotle mayo and guacamole sauce. I'd like to try the campechano taquitos next time. 

The prices may be a bit high for individual items, but they do have combos such as the 3 taquitos for $14.99. They're a good option near the Ryerson campus.",2,176
340,"A Yonge and Eglinton staple. This Italian restaurant is always bursting at the seams with customers and loud laughter. And there's a good reason for that - it is truly delicious. 

While not one of the fancier Italian restaurants in the neighbourhood, this restaurant truly lives up to the hype with their incredibly long selection of menu items and the amazing quality of food. 

My go-to dish is the Bosco pasta. Creamy, filled with a variety of mushrooms, and topped with fresh rosemary. Absolutely to die for. Their gluten free corn pasta has the same consistency as regular pasta and tastes delicious!

I love how the menu breaks up the pasta by the type of sauce it's in. There's nothing worse than having to guess whether the pasta is doused in a cream sauce or simply olive oil. The pastas are broken down into tomato sauce, extra virgin olive oil & garlic, creamy tomato sauce, and cream sauce. 

The menu also boasts a long selection of pizzas! You can opt for the classic Margherita or a speciality pizza (the Elena is to die for).

326,"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!",0,326

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too.",1,406
3,"Okay, so I found my new favourite Latin spot. I was frequenting the other Playa Cabana on Dundas W - however they changed their menu and all went to hell in my opinion. I recently dined at Playa Cabana and was wow'd. This place really needs 5 stars because the food was AMAZING, but it gets 4 stars because the service was pretty bad. 

It wasn't busy at all when I walked in, maybe 2 tables were full. I kinda already knew what I wanted (who else checks the menu before hand) lol. 

Ordered the short rib tacos because holy hell it sounded amazing, short rib enchiladas (yes, I love short rib) grilled Mexican corn, the tres leche cake & Churros. Relax, relax, I wasn't alone. The tacos were delicious, please please don't change the menu! I have to say the Enchiladas were my favourite. The beans had so much flavour, the sauces were perfect & the combination of all the flavours with the extra sauces on the table made my life complete! The grilled corn was okay, but nothing special. 

Moving on to the highlight - Dessert! Wow! The Churros were actually fucking amazing. So crunchy, so much sugar. The cake was nothing like I've tasted, so moist and light. I could have eaten 3 slices! 

PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE MENU! I will be back! 

Keep Eating,

144,"The food was just ok but, I'm sure they can do much better. I think is a bit overpriced for what you get, mexican food is not supposed to be fancy and overpriced",1,144
178,"The place is a small take away joint near Ryerson University, a one amongst many others serving different cuisines. It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor.",1,178
39,"Delicious, unpretentious tacos in a hidden gem of a restaurant. 

Ended up here after reading positive Yelp reviews. The tacos are delicious, well-balanced and inexpensive for the serving size. You're much better coming here for food alone, vs. going to the majority of Mexican tapas places in the city that are more for the ambience. 

Also, I ended up talking to some of the employees and I asked them about the name. It's derived from when Donald Trump accused Mexicans of being rapists, criminals, etc- a bunch of ""bad hombres"". Good on Good Hombres for putting some positive vibes out into the world.  

Please note, there is only bar seating here so it's not great for groups. More for quick eats.",2,39
671,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive.",1,671
492,"The first thing we noticed upon stepping foot into this restaurant was the clean looking, upscale decor. A very pleasant surprise for a Chinese restaurant in the middle of Chinatown!

We ordered the baked pork chop with rice and baked beef brisket with rice. They first served us our complimentary soup, which was one of three of their daily soups. We chose the chinese and tomato soups.

The soups came out immediately, which gave us something to sip on while waiting for the main dishes. The chinese soup was light and pleasant, and the tomato soup was rich and flavourful.

The main dishes came about ten minutes later. Even though it was my first time trying the much hyped tomato pork chop, I knew immediately that it was definitely worth the hype! The pork chops were crispy coming straight out of the oven, and the tomato sauce was the best tasting thing I've ever had in Chinatown. It was just so rich, juicy, creamy, and delicious overall. The beef brisket was also great. The amount of brisket was a very generous portion, and the brisket itself was very tender and soft.

I'd definitely recommend Hong Kong Bistro Cafe for their HK style baked dishes. They're quite different from other types of Chinese cuisine, and definitely worth a try!",2,492
379,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

RELATED - Traveling to Toronto? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2LETSfV",0,379
43,"What a great place! Small place but all the food is amazing. Very authentic. Great tacos & sauces. Service is great! The guacamole was delicious, the salsas fresh & full of taste.",2,43
50,"After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable.",1,50
245,"Oh yes padre. I have been salivating over this place for for quite some time now and when I was able to finally visit I was glad to see I wasn't disappointed!

My friend and I went on a Friday night at 5pm and to our delight there was no line up! Their dining area is very small and they don't do reservations. It's decorated with red and white table linens and there's a simple chalk menu board above where the cashier is. This area is for takeout orders. We sat down and our waitress came by to give us some advice about her favs which helped.

We got mozzarella sticks to start which was served with their signature sugo. They were super tasty. We also got a caesar salad. It was very fresh and super garlicky, just the way I like it! My friend got the gnocchi that came with their signature sugo (sauce) and I got chicken parmigiana with spaghetti in sugo. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken, and the mountain of spaghetti was HUGE. I seriously had leftovers for 2 meals after that. 

The chicken parmigiana was magnificent, tender and flavourful. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and sauce was deliziosa. I had some of my friend's gnocchi too and wish I got too because it was so tasty, light and fluffy little pillows of gnocchi heaven.

We got tiramisu afterwards to share for dessert. Honestly at this point I was surprised we were able to have anything else. The tiramisu was so good. A good portion and it was one of the best tiramisus I've ever had!

Can't wait to come back here for the other dishes!",2,245
314,Amazing food! Amazing service!! Best pizza!!! Like amazing the buratta is seriously the best in toronto,2,314
191,"Was at Mariachis on Saturday night for dinner and I left a happy camper! It is a family run establishment; sweetest ladies ever!

Its not fancy and pretentious, very laid back vibe, decor that is typical of mexican restaurants and they have a live band playing. The waitresses laugh and joke with patrons and give great recommendations for food and drinks. Test out your Spanish skills with them, they love it!

We waited a tad long for our food but the staff apologized a few times and checked in so we didn't really notice.

All in all a great experience, I definitely suggest making reservations!",2,191
375,It was under cooked noodle and no savory at all in my pasta. Overpriced and it's not worth to paying for it.,0,375
518,"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail.",1,518
154,"My favourite restaurant in the Beach, and some of the best Mexican food in the city. Not the cheapest, but the food is high quality. Great margaritas, guacamole, and tacos. Fish tacos are light and delicate, with a lovely balance of flavours and texture.",2,154
228,"One of the most celebrated names in Italian food in Toronto is Buca. With two locations in the city, Chef Rob Gentile's original restaurant opened in 2009 in the Fashion District. You don't have to look far to find the accolades. Canada's 100 Best Restaurants listed them at #3 in 2015, #17 in 2016, #16 in 2017, #44 in 2018, and #45 in 2019. Toronto Life has them at #39 on their The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 list. And blogTO calls them the #1 Best Italian Restaurant in the city. What's the difference between the (original) Fashion District location and the one in Yorkville? It's mainly that the Yorkville restaurant focuses more on seafood offerings while the Fashion District upholds the classics that everyone loves. Both locations are excellent and offer the exact same consistency and high level of culinary perfection.

The word ""buca"" in Italian translates to hole. Which makes sense because the restaurant pretty much resides in one. Formerly a boiler room, the space is now an expansive and gorgeous restaurant comprised of towering ceilings, all of the exposed brick that you could imagine, and industrial-cool light fixtures. Where the Yorkville location feels more polished and modern, this one is rustic and mysterious. It actually feels a bit like dining in a wine cellar, among stacked bottles and wine barrels. Finding the entrance on King Street can be a little bit tricky because the signage isn't extremely obvious and you have to enter through the laneway. Then you proceed down the stairs and into the depths of the subterranean feast that awaits you. I visited on a Saturday evening - for my birthday, no less. The room is always full of customers and a reservation is certainly recommended.

Met by the friendly and professional staff at the bottom of the stairs, our coats were whisked away and we were seated at our table immediately. The experience felt special right from the very start.

In need of a beverage, I found myself looking over the list of seasonal and house cocktails. I also appreciated the addition of virgin cocktails, because there are certainly times when I don't feel like drinking alcohol but still appreciate the opportunity to order something interesting. However, this wasn't one of those times and the seasonal Frutto Divino (Fresh persimmon puree, calvados, chamomile, lime, egg white - $17.00) was calling to me. The persimmon in this 2oz cocktail caught my attention as it's my favourite seasonal fruit around the holidays. The egg white is the component that sealed my decision. This beverage was expertly mixed and tasted grown-up yet sweet at the same time. I loved the punchy zip from the lime and the fragrant sweetness from the persimmon.

The food at Buca is very serious business, although it somehow feels relaxed. The locally sourced, constantly changing menu involves ingredients that are seasonal and source specific. Nose-to-tail cooking is embraced at Buca (which I especially love). The hospitality is also top-notch, with every staff member exuding a welcoming and knowledgeable disposition. I was so ready to eat!

One famed menu item that I'd kept hearing about over and over was the Salumi di Buca (Selection of 5 salumi served with seasonal preserves - $32.00), a platter of incredible artisan cured meats. So of course the feast began with that. From left to right:

Speck: (which comes with the gnocco fritto, see below).

Petto d'Oca: Cured goose breast, cinnamon, clove, orange.

Salame Toscano: Cured beef sausage, black pepper.

Finocchiona: Cured pork sausage, black pepper, fennel.

Soppressata: Cured beef sausage, calabrese spices.

Salsiccine: Spicy calabrese style pork sausage.

We also added the Gnocco Fritto (Tuscan spiced dumplings, speck - $10.00), a personal favourite, which was served on the same board. This whole entire situation was heavenly. Served with an acidic eggplant preserve (which served amazingly to cut through some of the fat), the beautiful presentation of meats ranged from spicy soppressata to a decadent goose breast that tasted like Christmas. Each one was unique, expertly seasoned, and fragrantly herbed. Largely based in seasonal offerings, I want to keep returning to order this so that I can try different meats every time. A beautiful sharing experience.

The gnocco fritto, a warm, pillowy fried bread, especially owns my soul. From the perfectly uniform shape of each one, to the steamy aroma as you tear them apart, these are what dreams are made of. Served with buttery, melt-in-your-mouth speck, an intensely flavourful cured ham.

I also couldn't resist the Nodini (Warm bread knots, olive oil, rosemary, garlic - $8.00). At this point I was willing to accept that this meal was going to be extremely carb-heavy. I mean, who says ""no"" to perfect little bread balls? A golden, buttery crust on the outside that gives way to a warm and soft inside. All soaking in a garlicy bath.

So things were going well.

Next I took my attention to the Paste section because",2,228
33,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison.",0,33
651,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.
Buyers Beware.",0,651
525,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!",0,525
267,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1,267
184,"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!",1,184
305,"Amazing fine-dining Italian restaurant in Yorkville. On Friday's and Saturday's they have live entertainment which is such a cute touch. Loved the upscale vibes, food and service all exceptional. Large inside with lots of seating. The best beef carpaccio in the city! Would recommend to anyone!",2,305
471,"When going to Jacobs, you know you'll be getting the finest cuts of steak in town, attentive service, and a memorable experience. I can't say this second visit to Jacobs offered all of that. 

PEI oysters: Great to start with - accompanied with hot sauce (not seafood sauce), black vinegar, and fresh horseradish. Fresh and high quality

Steaks: Very glad that our waiter was open to serving a Chicago style blue rare steak, which was finely executed (minus whoever cut open the steak to check how well it was cooked). The 45 day dry aged striploin was marvellous, perfectly and evenly cooked as expected. The waiter explained all steaks in good detail and helped us make a decision. 

To finish: Without reminding them that we were celebrating a birthday, they decorated our dessert with was very thoughtful! Delicious muffins are given to take home, and small chocolates to end the meal. 

The negative: Personally I did not like our waiter who seemed very ""pushy"". He would recommend drinks and desserts before we asked for recommendations, and made it very awkward to choose otherwise. Also he rarely made visits to our table, taking away from the experience.  

Overall the ambiance is great, food is perfect, but service is not as professional as I would expect from one of the finest steakhouses in Canada.",2,471
542,"Nice staff
Simple interior
About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair.
It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later.
Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well.
Did I mention 4 hrs later..
Not so good!
Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me.",0,542
62,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings.",1,62
543,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1,543
202,"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!",0,202
127,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,",1,127
603,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0,603
413,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special.",1,413
440,"Can't belive I haven't rated the original Banh Mi Boys.. its so good! Lots of fresh fun things like Banh Mis, Kimchi Fries and Baos. Last time I was here we had to order everything. So much food! 

Real taste of Toronto/ LA",2,440

The bad? The wait time. But I hit the jackpot tonight, without much wait time. 

Too loud for a decent conversation. If you want a full on conversation and not wanting to scream on top of your lungs,t with your louder than usual voice. Then this is not the place for you.",2,218
346,"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional.",1,346

Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it.",0,369
423,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians",1,423

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0,222
388,"i tried this place out on a week night for my birthday w.3 of my gfs. we ordered 4 pasta dishes and a charcuterie board to share. our server (short redish hair) didnt seem enthused all night..not sure if thats just how she was..but definitely not on the friendly side. she seem quite hostel towards us than the other server we saw.. but we made our own night fun w.each other! 
service 3/5.

the salami charcuterie board was ok..nothing in particular wowed us with it. she brought it out and dropped it on our table. no explaination as to what was what..didnt know which salami/cured meat was which..didnt even know which cheese selection they had given us either.. it wouldve been nice to know what we were feasting on..i know my friend requested more salami and a cheese that wasnt so strong. i think they gave us brie cheese..

we then got the 4 pastas: orecchiette, bolognese, pappardelle & carbonara.
all of it was really good! forgot to ask for the pastas to be cooked a little more well but the flavours are nice.
braised rabbit was tender. fennel sausage had a nice kick. bolognese meat sauce was delicious carbonara wasnt overly creamy.

overall food 4/5.

atmosphere was nice. dim lit, cute little lights hung through out. lots of seating and tables throughout the place. not sure how busy it would be on a weekend..but id love to come back and try their pizzas!",1,388
89,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied.",1,89
545,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!",1,545
117,"This has been a regular lunch spot for me this past year though I won't be returning . 

Last visit lunch two other tables only 2 waiters .

Wine ordered was old and smelled like vinegar.

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Both bowls for dips were still wet and beans tasted like dish soap .

Ordered water with ice did not ever arrive . Taco was okay but not what it used to be .

Cheese in a taco being extra at a Mexican restaurant is wired to me as well .

I wish they kept the same service quality as when they opened . 

We won't be going back .",0,117
529,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1,529
282,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!",0,282
223,"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey.",0,223
116,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue.",1,116
412,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area.",1,412
547,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0,547
663,"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish",1,663
354,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!",1,354
20,"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!",2,20
207,"I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother",0,207
623,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case.",1,623
637,"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.",1,637

Inside is pretty packed. Our table was next to the washroom lol

Their pastas were fresh and tasty and cooked at a good expected al dente. The burrata was a really nice appetizer to start with as it was nice and light, but creamy too. The waiters were helpful and attentive in serving us. 

Nodo is a really decent Italian place without paying an outrageous price.",2,400
573,"Totally in love with this place. I always come and order hot pot for my meal and feel really full whenever I finish. 
I would recommend try hot pot with noodles. 
When you become a regularly customers, the manager will give u the soy milk for freee. Lol that's what I love from this store. I love the way the manager treat his customers. They're so nice",2,573
511,"The food was great and reasonably priced, we had the sweet and sour chicken, steamed pork & chive dumplings, and mixed vegetables. 
The service was fast and they told us it was cash-only upfront which I liked. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was how tight/cramped the place was. The place was full (about 6:00pm Wednesday). It was difficult to walk through the aisles between the tables, and the tables are tiny so you have to Tetris all your plates to fit properly, but otherwise it was really tasty and I'd for sure go back for the food.",2,511
658,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1,658
238,"Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation.

Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you're getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can't provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I've never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I'm leaving a three star",1,399

Their staff are as professional as they come. A very pleasant dim sum experience",2,605

452,"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list",1,452
387,"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time.",0,387

488,"I love this place! Really hits the spot for some chinese fast food/afternoon snackies. Might be a bit hard to find, they usually have a sign outside with their specials and you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the actual restaurant.

My personal favourite is the pork chop baked rice - I pretty much get this every single time.

They have everything on the menu from fries and chicken wings to fried rice to baked oysters. If you can imagine it, they can probably make it! They also have a bunch of daily specials that also come with a soup (either cream or borscht) and I think a drink included in the price - a pretty good deal if you want something more plentiful.",2,488
505,"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service.",1,505
517,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1,517
103,"I decided to check this place out during my never ending taco obsession phase. The patio looks pretty with twinkling lights and a mini fire pit on one of the middle tables. I came on 2 separate occasions & Chula did not disappoint! Both times I had the fried calamari appetizer, shrimp, fish & chicken tacos. The amount of food was filling because usually I could probably eat like 8 tacos and still be hungry. I'm not a fan of the location so I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but I'd definitely come back if I were in the area.

I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity.",1,656
457,"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).

Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food.",2,457

Chicken chalupas are my personal favourite - hand crafted corn tortillas smothered in chicken, beans and salsa. Expect a mess. Use your hands here. 
Home made ice creams- avocado and caramel...just as you think you are sugared out pop a churro in your mouth. No words. Good for families or date night. Tequilla, mojitos, sangria and margaritas as well as wines by the glass.",2,214

79,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review.",1,79
498,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1,498
152,"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively.",0,152
408,Was recommended by our hotel staff and was not disappointed. Food and staff were phenomenal. I will come back.,2,408
95,"This place use to be good, but not anymore. The tacos tasted the same, hardly any chicken was found in my ""chicken burrito,"" and $11.95 + tax for a few SMALL pieces of calamari. I won't be returning.",0,95
23,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning.",0,23
556,Little family friendly run restaurant. Polite staff. Dumplings were amazing. Very fresh and delicious.,2,556
577,"Fixed my noodle craving here and it's unlimited noodles too.

I usually get their Picked Cabbage soup because it's simple and not too heavy. On the side, get the spicy cold noodles. They're AMAZING",2,577
237,"I wanted to give this pace 5* because of their great service and freebies. I mean, it's a cute, tiny place, the 2 people who were staffing (older Asian man and youngish Asian girl) were nice, and they gave us a free app (squash on zucchini with some type of sauce) and a free crème brûlée at the end: 1 for 2 to share. 

So service-wise, it was a definite 5/5. I felt like a real VIP here. 

Carbonaras ($17) looked great and so did the coffees. However, they had run out of Italian coffee, so that was a tad odd. 

I had the lobster pasta in red sauce (that's actually its description, and the price of $38 was not disclosed in the menu). Man, that was a GIANT plate. Getting the meat was a real workout but worth. They gave a whole lobster with the proper equipment and lemon water so I didn't smell like PEI after. 

Lobster was good, I'm sure, but the sauce was too overwhelming to get the taste of lobster. Then again, lobster is generally mild but still. Pasta texture and all was great. Sauce was a little spicy but I think I should have mixed it all up first so the spice wasn't just on the top. 

Crème brûlée was great! The caramel was a little thick but I guess some like it thick. The custard was very smooth, no lumps, and it wasn't cold. I know that's a weird expectation but I've had cold, liquid custard before... as a crème brûlée. I def recommend this dessert. The portion was just right for 2 people. 

Would I recommend? Yes, because it's at an average price (maybe $1 pricier than other places) but with spectacular service.",2,237
343,We arrived at 9:34 pm two times and they didn't let us to be seat because kitchen is closed. Operation hours indicated til 10 pm and they blocked customer come in 30mins before that doesn't make sense.,0,343
391,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least.",0,391
181,"Hi, i went to eat lunch here today with my friends and i had a wonderful experience. The space is so clean and beautiful. The food is the best mexican food in toronto. So much variety in their menu. They also have their signature desert. The price is very good too.i am coning back only here for mexican food. The staff is so friendly and fast",2,181
92,"Came here the other day with my friend and ordered two tacos. The steak taco ($4) and the baja fish taco ($7.50). The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving.",1,92
159,"Where do I start! This review is long over due as you can see I visited during patio season. They have huge patio with a fire pit! 

This place has the best Mexican food and drinks and needs to be on everyone list of places to check out! I recommend getting a margarita or the horchata colada and tacos and the chips & guac.",2,159
122,"Recently stopped by on a Sunday, and then retaliated that is been here earlier this year as well haha. Both times were similar in experience - meaning good service and good food. The margaritas are yummy and proper. The decor is bright and fun. When we came most recently it was a bit slow and close to kitchen closing so they gave us extra meat on our platter - which I thought was nice. Their churros are delicious - crisp on the outside and soft inside served with spiced hot chocolate to dip. The chorizo empanadas were also top notch and made fresh to order.  
If I'm ever there when it's not freezing out then I'd like to sit on their patio.",2,122
147,"Came here on a weeknight and was really pleasantly surprised with the whole experience.

The food was really great, and the price made it even better. I got enchiladas; they were really tasty, not super greasy, and the portion size was big. 

Our server was friendly and pretty attentive considering she was alone during the dinner rush.

If you're looking for some sleek modern decor, go somewhere else because this place has more of a family restaurant/low key vibe. 

All in all, a great place to go for generous portion sizes, good prices, and a chill atmosphere.",2,147

321,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained.",1,321
329,"Family style authentic Italian restaurant. I really enjoy 7 numbers having been here a few times now. I personally think it's a great menu for sharing so come with a small group. 

Service and atmosphere were all good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a bit of a rustic type of feeling to it.

Veal meatballs - 5/5 this is my favourite thing on the menu. Super tasty, eat this with the special hot pepper sauce they have. I think it's perfect.

Lamb shank - 3.5/5 a little bland at my most recent visit but still a good dish

Calamari - 4/5 pretty small portion but fresh

Pasta 4/5 I don't recall which of the 3 choices they have we got but you got could taste the fresh ingredients being used",2,329
598,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0,598
73,"Totally disappointing - everything is definitely on the over-seasoned/extremely salty side. Or totally BURNT! 

The chips we were served were totally burnt and we were told they were the batch of the day and there was nothing they can do about it. (Check pic)

The chips were followed by a totally burnt batch of corn- were not talking grill marks here, crust black corn. We were told that how it's severed (no it's not, we've been here before!). Is there no one to check what comes out of the kitchen??

To add insult to injury chewed on an avocado pit in the guacamole. 

Hosting and service were another issue. Extremely disappointing experience all in all. Fails at all basic hospitality and restaurant standard.",0,73
304,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver",1,304
64,"Seriously great tacos here! The first time I went was not long after they'd opened for business and it took a while to get my order, despite being the only customer at the time. They make everything fresh to order, including the tortillas, so I wasn't too disappointed about waiting. 

On my last visit, I was with four of my coworkers on our lunch break. There were a few other people in the restaurant as well, so I worried it might take too long for our food - I had a meeting to get to, so I was keeping my eye on the clock. 

To my pleasant surprise, the food was coming out quickly. Since all five of us had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 special, they basically just made one of each order at a time, so we could all start eating at the same time. By the time we'd finished our first taco, the next one would be ready. Great system. 

I had three different tacos: fish, carnitas and chorizo. It's hard to pick a favourite as they were all fantastic, but most everyone in our group raved about the fish tacos. The batter was so light and crunchy, and not at all greasy. But I'd take any of them again in a heartbeat. 

The guys working there were super friendly and really quick to keep things moving along. The restaurant itself is very small, with only about 6-8 stools available to sit down to eat. Not super comfortable, so it's not really somewhere you'd want to spend too much time. 

I'll likely get takeout next time. Maybe a burrito...",2,64
536,"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.

As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. 

We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. 

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here.",1,536
203,"Located in a side street of Koreatown, this place is a little hidden gem. Though the entrance before you walk in is large and they have signs indicating it's a restaurant, you would have never thought there would be a restaurant hidden within a side residential street. 

We came on a Friday night around 6:30 and we were the only people there. It slowly started to get busy after. The food is great and not very pricey at all. It is authentic Mexican food. We ordered a corn appetizer and it was really good. The tacos were good and my grapefruit margarita on the rocks just hit the right spot. Definitely worth trying out this place and I'll definitely come back when I'm craving for tacos.",2,203
128,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street.",1,128
396,"From beginning to end a wonderful dining experience. The service was expert and unobtrusive, very attentive with several servers assigned to each table. The ceasar salad was very credible, better by far than most, followed next by one of the best Spaghetti Pescatore's I've had. The dish had mussels, manila clams, shrimp, calamari and scallops; there was no shortage of good quality fresh seafood. A very light tomato based sauce reduced with a seafood stock dressed the perfectly cooked aldenti pasta. A good quality Red Velvet cake is very hard to fine has been my experience not at Donatello there's is one for the ages. The restaurant has it all together, you will find that menu items are made fresh to order  so expect wait times to be longer but well worth the delay.",2,396

467,"I've been to Miku many times for work lunches, but this time I popped by for their winterlicious menu  which was $33 for lunch. The items offered were very similar to their regular menu, which makes this one of the better 'licious menus. I ordered the sashimi plate, the aburi, and their signature matcha cake as a dessert. The quality did not differ from their regular service which is always a good sign of consistency. 

I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't the best I've had at this price point. However, I would and do continue to come back as it is so central in the city. I definitely would recommend for first timers who don't want to break the bank for good sushi.",2,467
642,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1,642

Service as usual was great.

67,"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ...",1,67
373,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server.",1,373
341,"I went around 12:30pm on a weekday and this place was only half filled so i didnt have to wait at all for seats! I ordered the Elena pizza and I have to say this was one of the best pizza I have ever had in Canada! The pizza was made thin crusted and it had the perfect thickness to my tasting. The toppings consisted of mozzarella, grilled chicken and spinach which you cant go wrong with. I usually don't eat crust but I had no problem finishing the crust of this pizza because it was not dry and hard at all. I shared this with one other person and we were both very full afterwards. 

Ps: Every table also came with a basket of bread along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar for us to dip in.",2,341
