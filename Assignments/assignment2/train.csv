439,"Wowww this spot has some GOOD banh mi sandwiches.

Stopped by right after they opened on a Sunday and there were already people eating. Small spot designed mostly for take out, but there is some seating. Our group each bought a bahn mi and some sides, including fries and some boas 
I like traditional/standard banh mi sandwiches. Banh mi boys goes well beyond traditional and had some very interesting options, including the kabli beef which I got. It combined the traditional ingredients of a banh mi with Korean style beef... delicious. The sandwiches are quite large so don't feel like you need a lot of sides, or maybe share a sandwich and some sides.
We also spit some kimchi fries, which are truly LOADED, with fries, poutine, kimchi, bbq style meat and more. The portion is massive. They are delicious and loaded with tons of ingredients.",2,439
231,"Absolutely another one of those hidden gems! I very much recommend going if you're looking for delicious yet affordable cheap eats!

I had the prosciutto bruschetta toast. Unlike the bruschetta with the diced tomato, this is more of your open sandwich idea. The bread was garlic bread! Super pleasing. The prosciutto was plentiful and the arugula was a great match.

We sat in and it took little time to get our food. The server was genuinely so nice and attentive. 

I really recommend stopping by and enjoy a no frills eating environment.",2,231
619,"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services.",1,619
257,"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back.",1,257
420,"Ok, let's get this out of the way: I have no idea why this is the 9th best restaurant in Canada in 2019, and you'll be massively disappointed if you expect it to be. Checking for expectations though, it's good. We managed to grab an early dinner slot and got:
- Pulpo e Fagioli: The octopus was really tender, you could cut through it easily with the typical blunt table knife. The swipe of salsa verde and the bed of cannellini beans didn't add much flavour though.
- La Giulietta: Their signature pizza was definitely worthy of their name. This will sound weird, but my favourite part was how good the dough was - thin yet not limp, great taste but not distracting to the toppings, held everything together well. Also, never had pistachios on pizza before and thought this was a great.
- Pappardelle al Ragu: The oxtail was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, though was let down by the pedestrian tomato sauce and a-bit-too-aldente pasta noodles.
- Fogo Island Cioppino: Kinda like an Italian bouillabaisse. Good flavour, though not enough seafood (cod, mussels, shrimp) for my liking.
- Dessert: Got the Red Fife Tiramisu and Gelato del Giorno, and both were winners. The tiramisu had a nice thick custard that made it a bit different. The seasonal soft serve gelato that day was chamomile, which, drizzled with honey, was just a perfect way to end the meal.

The prices were expectedly high, the place had a nice upscale hip vibe, the servers were tremendous, though the pacing of the meal was a bit too slow for me. Overall, Giulietta provided a good dining experience. Not 9th best, maybe not even 99th best. But there were enough hits to make it a worthwhile try.",2,420
374,It was under cooked noodle and no savory at all in my pasta. Overpriced and it's not worth to paying for it.,0,374
386,"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time.",0,386
390,Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.,1,390
246,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al dent√©. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1,246
473,"I came here for my birthday celebration. It was a surprise, so I was super excited when we stopped by this place. As we walked in, you walk up a very instagram-able set of stairs. We were greeted promptly, and offered coat-check.

We got a table by the live piano. The piano playing added a nice ambience to our dinner. But I found the piano a little bit too loud at times, so it was hard to hear my date talk. But I did enjoy how he would play to the age group of the crowd. I didn't enjoy my 'sofa seat' that much because it was too low for me to eat properly. It sank in a lot as well. 

Our server explained the menu to us, and recommend that we share a steak and order two to three sides. 

We ordered:
14oz Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus rib eye - medium rare $91
Table Side Caesar Salad - $26 
Mushroom Risotto - $26
Duck Fat Fries - $17 

Each table started with their house made brioche - which was crispy on the outside and fluffy and hollow on the inside. It also came with their garlic butter, which was buttery goodness. 

Then came the Caesar Salad. The salad was more of a show where the severs would roll a cart of ingredients for the salad to your table and make it in front of you. It was a nice touch to see them make everything from scratch. The salad maker didn't really talk to us or try to make conversation so it was a little disappointing. (I saw the table next to us have a full on conversation with their salad maker).

The salad was good, but not the best caesar salad I ever had. It was a nice balance of cheese, and smoked bacon and a hint of anchovies. If you aren't the biggest fan of anchovies, you can ask for it on the side. I did find it a bit fishy at times. 

Next, came the steak, which was cooked to perfection. I've never had such a tender and perfectly cooked steak. It was charred on the outside on an iron skillet. The steak came with charcoal salt, herbed salt, and pink salt (super fancy). All the salts tasted the same, salty. The steak also came with a chimichurri sauce, blue cheese and yuzu shoyu. I enjoyed the blue cheese the most. The salts and the blue cheese, brought out the beef flavour. Hands down, this is one of the best steaks I've ever had.

The risotto was good as well. My date didn't enjoy it as much, but I didn't mind it. But, if given another opportunity, we probably would have gotten something else.

The duck fat fries were amazing. Who would have thought fries could be cooked this nicely. Every fry had a good ratio of crispiness and fluffiness. The fries came with two sauces, their house ketchup and a garlic mayo. 

We didn't get dessert, but the restaurant gives you a small tasting of their dessert free of charge. We got a small chocolate and a macaron. On the way out, they also give you chocolate muffins as a take-away. This was a nice touch.

Jacob's is definitely a fancier place. From the service, to the ambiance, decorations and even the bathroom, they make sure your visit is enjoyable. The server made sure to check up on us every so often, the water's were always filled, and our napkins were always folded if we left the seat. The elderly gentleman, at the entrance, even insisted in helping me wear my jacket  - even after I refused (I gave in). 

I would like to come back and try their other steaks. There is a Wagyu Steak that costs $880 - out of my price range, but this gives you an idea of the type / quality of steaks they have.",2,473
232,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon.",0,232
568,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1,568
83,"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about. 

I'd be open to coming back to try more of their extravagant tacos though :) judging from their menu the prices seemed reasonable for a downtown restaurant.",1,83
560,"This place is great! Very authentic and delicious dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, pan friend dumplings, fish ball soup and egg drop soup. 

Everything was amazing, very flavourful and the service was quick. 

I highly recommend this place, especially the soup dumplings.",2,560
375,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.",0,375
322,"The best thing about this place is the price of the food. Me and my wife went for dinner about an hour and a half before thier closing time on a Saturday night the place was less than half full. We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

If you're on a budget, don't care about good service or food quality then this is the spot for you!",0,322
407,"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs.",0,407
113,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue.",1,113
8,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole.",1,8
164,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette.",1,164

278,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it).",1,278
637,"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.

We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.

Like today, broccoli was old. 

Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough.",1,637
646,I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here,0,646
205,"Great place for dinner! Casual atmosphere with really great food! 

We sat in the patio area and had a few of their dishes. We had the cacio e pepe, tomahawk steak, margherita pizza, broccolini, and their rucola salad. Everything was really good! The steak was cooked perfectly, nice and tender. The rucola salad was fresh and love the dressing on it. Finished off with tiramisu and panna cotta... both very good. 

The service was really good and they have a nice wine menu. Would love to go back to try some other things on the menu.",2,205
348,"OK
in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore.",0,348
249,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it.",1,249
491,"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make.",0,491
7,"My favourite Mexican fast food restaurant! By fast food, I mean you order and pay upfront (with no tip necessary) and they will bring the food when ready.

Seating is limited so sharing the table with others is needed. However given it is fast food restaurant, a lot of people choose to grab and go instead. The deco is very friendly and has the casual Mexican vibe. 

Last time I was here I ordered the $4.5 classic taco. It came with chips that you can dip in a varieties of free salsa (some spicy, some refreshing and none to complain about) and hot sauce. I think it is good value and quite tasty. However the lady who we shared the table with ordered the Fajita, a ""sizzling"" skillet that is worth being jealous over. 

So when we went there tonight, I did not hesitate to order the chicken Fajita and wow it did not disappoint. The skillet was sizzling hot when presented. You can hear the sizzling sound and smelled amazing. The chicken is flavourful with some peppers and onion. The chicken by itself could have been too oily or too salty but the skillet came with taco bread, guacamole (amazingly fresh and probably made in store) and fresh lettuce. I was really impressed by this dish and definitely became one of my favourite.

I think this place could be busy sometime and the wait time would be long. But with food this good (and free salsa), I think it is worth the wait. I will definitely will go back :)",2,7
633,"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.",0,633
552,"Stepped into the restaurant and was surrounded by endless tanks of freakishly large crabs. We got the Hong Kong style lobster (4.83 lbs) lunch set that included soup, fried rice, snow pea with goji berries, and dessert. It was nice that we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We also had a lot of food at the end to take home too

Honestly though I started to get sick of the lobster after a few bites since it is fried and quite oily. I ended up eating the veggies/fried rice instead! I also find I prefer lobster fried with ginger and scallion more than HK style. Service was incredibly slow when we went.

Overall I think it was good to try, but I don't know if I would return again. I think it'd be good for special occasions or to treat people that like seafood due to the visual wow factor of the dish though!",1,552
496,"If you find yourself in downtown Toronto looking for asian food, head to Lee Chen Asian Bistro.  The place is downstairs from the sidewalk and is huge inside...I mean huge.  I suspect they do a great lunch business, but we came after a hockey game on our way back to the hotel. 

The service was prompt and always available if you need anything.  The bar/beer scene doesn't offer a lot, but there are a few options to pick from if your in need. 

The spring rolls and chicken dumplings were really, really good.  I had sweet and sour chicken which is some of the best I have ever had anywhere.  

I definitely would go back and probably spend more time ordering a lot of dim sum as there is a lot to pick from if that is your jam.  They have a huge menu and one trip is not going to satisfy your palate.",2,496
649,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.
Buyers Beware.",0,649
593,"Unfortunately, this area does not have any other nearby places for dim sum. So there are no competitive prices for morning dim sum, and the food itself is not the best, when compared to restaurants in Markham, etc. However, considering this is the only place available, I think it's a good option when you're craving dim sum and do not want to commute or drive for an hour.

We tried the seafood dumplings (very doughy), fish congee (really nice), fried shrimp dumplings (tasty, essentially fried har gow), and spinach dumplings (very doughy). I do not eat meat and so didn't try the siu mai, tripe and pepper short rib, but heard that the latter two were quite tough and chewy. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. If we're in the area again and hungry for dim sum, I would come back, but it would not be my first choice. Most dishes were $4-5, and our bill came to $40 total.",2,593
350,"Eataly is located in the Manulife Centre at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor.  

What at this point most likely takes the largest footprint of this facility, it may have been Ashley before the major renovation.  Eataly Toronto is like Eataly Flatiron approximately fifty thousand square feet.  That's quite a footprint considering this is on multiple levels in an uptown location of Bloor-Yorkville.  For Eataly though you need a large footprint to be able to house multiple food counters, restaurants, full blown grocery options, walls of products and a place for cooking classes.  

For those that don't know Eataly is basically a huge Italian superstore.  This store may not have everything you're looking for that is Italian in that they don't have Ferarri or Lamborghini for sale but they do have prosciutto from Modena and many other places for that matter.  Looking for Grana Padano or Reggio Parmigiana?  Will a wheel do?  The guy working the cheese counter said somebody came in and bought half a wheel cut lengthwise for a wedding just the other day.  

While the place doesn't have Santa Maria Novella like the NYC Flatiron store they do have on premise made beer at the birroteca on the concourse level.  Using Italian hops and other ingredients Eataly Toronto has the only on premise brewery of all the Eataly establishments so that's sort of special.

I had out of town guests and while my wife has been to Eataly Toronto already I had not been so my first visit was going to be with the out of towners.  We spent quite a bit of time at the olive oil wall as they were trying samples and deciding which to get.  My wife picked one she knew she wanted without trying any samples.  My friends tried a variety and eventually bought one and also a bottle of balsamic to go with it.  My friends ended up getting fresh ravioli nearby as well.

It was mid afternoon on a Friday and the pasta and Neapolitan pizza restaurants had some seating but we were already going to eat a few hours later at a place we made reservations for earlier in the day.  I noticed the Roman style pizza bar was quite popular and a quicker option.  I had the Roman pizza in the Eataly in Century City and I prefer it to the Neapolitan actually.  I like the crunch and the variety of slices I can get in one sitting and while Neapolitan doesn't take very long to make the Roman slices are ready.

Overall Eataly is overwhelming.  While I've been to 3 others (NYC - Flatiron, Chicago, LA - Century City) I found Toronto's to be as good as at least Flatiron but less streamlined.  Toronto's version is more like an Ikea gauntlet that makes you go through the entire store to say get to the gelato bar.  At Flatiron and Chicago the Lavazza and gelato can be accessed at the first floor level without having to go all the way in.  The Toronto setup has the caf√© type areas in the area on the upper level facing Bloor where there's the pasta/pizza area, bar, coffee/dessert stand, Roman pizza all in a corner.

The content of Eataly Toronto is basically all there in an unfamiliar footprint albeit still somewhat organized.  I like this concept and I'll be back to try the other offerings like the pizza and pasta.",2,350
136,"I'm all for small, authentic , family run business , and this is exactly what you get at Mexico Lindo. 
My friend and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon & we were one of two tables. I ordered the guacamole, & fish tacos (on special on Wednesday's) & my friend ordered the beef chimichanga. 
The guacamole was amazing- lasted us 3-4 refills of chips. It was fresh, smooth & the perfect consistency. I just wish it came with better salsa (tasted like the basic Tostitos one out of the jar). 
The fish tacos- were okay at most. Not much flavour in the tacos (I've had better at JOEYS & other chain restos). Their rice however was fresh & delicious and their salad tasted like a Greek salad but was still very good. Also- there was nothing spicy or flavourful about the dish which is why I was  disappointed. 
The chimichangas- my friend ordered beef but got chicken. Not the biggest deal to us but still odd how the waitress forgot when we were one of two tables. She liked her dish and it was so filling! 

Overall, my friend and I both left with take out boxes because of how filling everything was. Majority - if not all- plates come with beans, rice & salad. Service and food were mediocre at best (the birchmount express location is much better) but I will come back here to support the family's business.",1,136

97,"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again.",0,97

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0,210
298,"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money.",0,298

667,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars.",1,667
344,"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional.",1,344
672,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Everything from the customer service to the delicious food. I ordered two chicken Puebla tacos  and two carnitas tacos. They were fresh, tasty, and hit all the right flavours. Simple and authentic tacos which heavily focused on good quality meat with minimal filler other than some fresh pico and/or pickled onions (this is how tacos are supposed to be). I came back about 20 minutes later and ordered 4 more tacos because they're were literally THAT good. 

Please check this place out. These guys are legit! The dude wearing the supreme hat was super nice and knowledgeable about the food he was serving. I will definitely be going back very very soon.

489,"Dailo's tasting menu is hands down the best meal I've ever had in Toronto. Period! This is solely my opinion, as someone at the table beside me actually LICKED their plate. Yup, I saw that! 

We came to Dailo on a Saturday night to celebrate a birthday. I called a week in advance to book a table for Saturday night and if you plan to visit, I suggest you do the same. It gets packed! I specifically requested the corner table by the window to get a little more privacy, as the seating arrangement is very tight. 

We knew that we wanted to try the tasting menu, given that we've never been to the restaurant before.  It did not disappoint! For $65.00 pp, we received a total of five courses each (10 in total), plus a refreshing dessert. The tasting menu changes with every visit, but the wait staff was kind enough to fulfill our  request of trying certain dishes (I.e. fried watermelon). Skip through the next couple of paragraphs to find out what the tasting menu consisted of, otherwise, stay for my rambling. 

The drinks menu is a little restrictive for those who may not want to order an entire bottle. There is an extensive wine and sake list, with only several options that are served by the glass. I'm a huge fan of orange wine and I was disappointed to find out that it was only served by the bottle. Nevertheless, there is a great selection of cocktails, beer/ciders, and spirits that provide a single serving. 

The decor of the restaurant is whimsical to say the least. From the outside, it has the aesthetic of a century-old storefront, whereas the inside is an ironic take on a 50s Hollywood movie about the ""Far East."" Given the precious name of the restaurant, this was surely done with sarcasm in mind. The bathrooms are tiger balm scented (no, I'm not joking), which again plays with nostalgia and irony all at the same time. 

The tasting menu blew us away! The entire dining experience took about two hours to complete and we never felt rushed. Check the photos for all the dishes that were included in the tasting menu. I will be surely returning!",2,489

620,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case.",1,620
54,"It is Valentine's Day, I was so happy my boyfriend came from the Netherlands to visit and we had the best day exploring the city, afterwards we were too tired to go out so opted to order in some good Mexican food! 

We consider ourselves taco connoisseurs, and often indulge in a tasty tactac. We were VERY excited to have so many taco options so we ordered 3 soft shells and 3 crispy shells (as other Mexican enthusiasts may know, is not as common as people may think to have both shells) 

To provide more context you didn't ask for ... this was the first MUCH anticipated spot on our taco tour of Toronto.

Cheese Quality (0 - cheese unaccounted for, still looking for it)

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly.

I had the giant meatball which was delicious although the sauce it came in was a bit too salty. The spaghetti was good (cooked al dente) and the portion size is huge. The best part of the meal was the tiramisu - it was creamy, decadent and chocolaty, get the tiramisu if you come to Sugo!",1,239
309,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations.",1,309
240,"Lets just say... it's defs the worth! When we first got there on a tuesday night we honestly didn't think it was that busy, since there was only a few people outside waiting. Oh man, we were wrong! When we inside to put our name on the list, ends up there was a 3 page waiting list & almost a 2 hour wait (currently 7:30ish). We went out for a bit then, realized they did take out. So instead of waiting the 2 hours, we ended up waiting 30mins & sat across the street on the bench - and well, though it wasn't ideal the food defs made up for it! Also, everything was fairly priced!! 

We got the mozzarella sticks, meatballs, pepper poppers, calamari & half pasta and half salad - and none of the food disappointed!! The mozzarella sticks had the cheesy pull, meatballs were soft and the sauce went perfect with it. As for the calamari, it was soft and perfectly salted!! The pasta and salad - if you get together you save $3, both were delicious and i would say probably one of my favourite caesar salads.

318,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained.",1,318

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before.",0,69
514,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0,514
607,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning.",0,607
211,"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey.",0,211
133,"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos.",1,133
102,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive.",1,102
413,"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location.",0,413
595,"I think I set my expectations too high for this place. Being chinese I keep hearing how good the dim sum was in toronto. I studied Yelp for a good while trying to find a dim sum place with good reviews. I looked at all different menus from different places and decided on this place. It was cash only so I had money exchanged after we crossed into Canada. We drove 2 hours (there was traffic) to get there. Had to pay for parking. It was a small hole in the wall place with literally 8 small tables total. I've been in many hole in the walls so no judging there...especially if the taste of the food was out of this world good! Not in this case...I must say that I've had better dim sum at a mediocre place in VA. MD by far has the best dim sum so if you're in the Rockville area, try out the dim sum there, both Cantonese and Taiwanese style! 
Anyways my family liked it but their not Chinese (my mixed family of Blasians) so to them, dim sum is dim sum. They did agree that we have better dim sum back home in VA/MD. 
The selection wasn't as great either but I did see the cook in the back making the dumplings fresh. My youngest son love dumplings and he commented that it wasn't as good as my mom's lol. Duh..of course grandma makes the best dumplings. 
The server was very nice but we wont be back. Dont believe the hype! Or at least not from here.",1,595
273,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice.",1,273
638,"We had a team member who was leaving work to pursue his dream job and we took him out for lunch. This place was suggested and quickly liked by a few.   

The restaurant managers/owners generally I think underestimate the power of mentioning a bit more details on the menu or at least a server who is knowledgeable about ingredients. In the absence of information I went the safest route of ordering a plain congee and a steamed bun. My order would easily have been more than double if the right information was provided. 

So on the limited items that I could have, my review is not a review per se. One cannot mess up a Congee and a bun.

However the food did not arrive all together and out of respect for others, all of us had to wait. Which resulted in food going cold. 

The congee and bun were as good as they can be",1,638
536,"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed. 

GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.

I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting.",1,536
492,"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier).",2,492
669,"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner.",0,669
222,"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)",1,222
248,"It's become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn't have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It's a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It's not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it's an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could've been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

It's just too bad about that ambiance.",1,248
624,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!",0,624
336,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre.",1,336
149,"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively.",0,149

I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!",0,678

We probably should have ordered the Sugo Platter, but didn't realize it was an option until afterwards. The rigatoni was definitely the star of the show - it was piping hot and full of flavor, with the pasta cooked perfectly.

The only reason I'm knocking a star off is because I'm a selfish American and they were taking American dollar-for-Canadian dollar to pay since we ran out of Canadian cash. It also seems like it would have been overwhelmingly busy if we had come at regular mealtimes, so try to go at a weird time like 3pm for lunch.",2,236

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much.",1,499
440,"AMAZING Vietnamese Sandwiches!!!!
AMAZING Vietnamese Sandwiches!!!

This stop was pre-planned for our trip to Toronto based on the awesome reviews and I wanted to have different cuisines while in town. When we arrived in Toronto, this was our first stop for a quick bite. but I was lucky that the parking we found was walking distance to the GEM!. 

It's a boutique restaurant franchise with limited seating and people tend to order, sit and eat if there's available seats and then leave. We were lucky to get seats as it was a busy Friday afternoon. 

I could tell my sisters were skeptical about the cuisine based on their facial expressions cause they never had this before. We ended up ordering a 5 spice pork belly, grilled chicken sandwiches, a grilled chicken Taco and fried chicken Bao. Everything was delicious from there reaction.
They were really impressed by taste and crunchiness of pickled toppings paired with the sauce. The pickled carrots and cucumbers really enhanced the flavor in these sandwiches. All I heard after that was ""hmmmmm this is good",2,440

Only thing I can ding them for is the temperature. I happen to like my soup dumplings destroy your mouth hot. That's how it served traditionally, this is how it should be served here.

615,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1,615
543,"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )",1,543

Their prices are on average $2 ish cheaper than Dagu and the concept is similar with a few differences in the toppings. I got their picked cabbage soup and man was it good. The soup came out bowling hot and it was hard to not want to drink it in a rush because the flavor was ON POINT. The reason why rated this second to Dagu is because the rice noodles are thinner and I prefer thicker noodles. All in all, 5/5 for value and variety.",2,577

612,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced.",0,612
488,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!",0,488

However, I am only giving it a 3 stars because I think the prices are high for what you get. Yes, the food is better than some of the cheaper restaurants in Chinatown.

I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious.

170,"I recently visited La Marquesita, and I have to say I really enjoyed their taquito, they lightly pass the tortilla through oil (makes it a little crunchy) and the filling for the beef is incredibly delicious -- spice levels can also be adjusted to your own taste. Whilst I haven't tried much else on the menu, the one thing I did have was pretty legit. I'd put it above the beef taco at 7 lives which is currently top rated in Toronto right now. Looking forward to going back! 

If you're hesitant to try due to limited reviews, I hope my suggestion urges you to try!",2,170
234,"This is one of my favourite newly found gems for great pasta! All the staff are extremely friendly and greet you right as you walk in. What's great about it is that you can't eat for here and pack it to go! Another great thing about Baretto Caffe is that you're able to pick what kind of pasta you'd like to eat (rotini, fettuccini, penne, etc.). I've had their ros√© rotini pasta and it's to die for. It tastes very authentic to their culture and its great for its price. I'd like to say that their food was the star of the show, however their service and friendliness of all the staff really made it one of the most enjoyable and pleasant dining experiences I've had, if not the best! I would go here again :)

675,"Regardless if you're Chinese food purist or a new age Asian fusion maven, you'll probably find something here that you'll like. 

Keep in mind you are dining in the double tree, so you will be paying for everything from the food to the service. 

I made a reservation for Christmas Eve dinner and it was quite busy. The star dishes here are really the Peking duck or lobster if you're having a big dinner party. The lobster can be cooked in two different styles, so I would opt for one fried and one steamed so you get some variety. The pork belly here is incredibly tender and the best I've had so far. I would stay away from the dim sum platter, as it leaves much to the imagination. However, their specialty dim sum seem to be a hit, so that may be something I'll have to come back and try. 

If you are parking in the hotel underground lot, the restaurant will cover part of the cost!",2,675
457,"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient. 

But yeah. It was ok. I've had better ramen...",1,457
127,"Located at the back of the El Gordo complex in Kensington Market is a little hole in the wall you will not want to miss. La Chilaca Taqueria serves up authentic delicious Mexican cuisine at a price point that will knock your socks off!

I ended up trying their daily special (two Pastor Tacos for $5.00) and was thoroughly impressed. First of all, these things are huge (similar to the ones at Seven Lives). They have a crisp, grilled double layered corn tortilla which was absolutely delicious - soft, pliable and surprisingly light with just a hint of sweetness and a slight charred flavour. What really amazed me was that the tortilla held together even with all the filling inside it!

The inside of the tortilla is stuffed with a generous amount of delicious, tender marinated pork which was then topped with fresh onions, pineapple and cilantro. I loved how the sweet juicy pineapples added a vibrant summertime feel to the well-seasoned meat and the cilantro complimented everything with a light citrusy and peppery overtone. I squeezed on a splash of lime for a bit more of a sweet citrus kick. And then added on some of the red spicy sauce to enhance the flavours (although in retrospect, I should have probably gone with the green mild sauce instead). Definitely a taco you won't want to miss!",2,127
171,"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips 

Price (2.5/5): a bit over priced for what you get

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!",1,171

53,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new.",0,53
547,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1,547

The best we had which I highly recommend:

-Eggplant kibbeh
-seared cauliflower 
-Spanish octopus
-ME fried chicken
-beef tartare 
- Turkish manti dumplings (the best ever)

Just order a little of everything and you can't go wrong!!",2,445
323,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off.",1,323

-Genuine & delicious Chinese food
-Cool atmosphere and modern internal decor
-BIG portion with not so expensive price
-CLEAN and tidy

162,"Wowwwwwww this place is BOMB. First of all, everything is in Spanish and if you come here, you should speak Spanish. They can speak English, but like... it's part of the experience. Speak Spanish if you can. The food was AH.MAZE.ING. Wow. The tacos were perfect. They gave us a lot of hot sauce and I must warn you - try the hot sauce first. Don't just put it in your mouth or on your food. It's extremely spicy. We had some Spanish ballads playing in the background and horchata to match (the horchata was great for dealing with that spicy hot sauce, too). The place is very small and it doesn't serve alcohol. Maybe try take out?",2,162
123,"Let's taco bout this. Affordable tacos with well sized portions. What else can you ask for ?

La chilaca taqueria is small taco shop serving delicious morsels for a great price!  Selling 3-5$ tacos and certain specials (like 10$ for 4 pastor tacos). 

I ordered the carne, pastor, carnitas, pollo, and fish. I only wish I didn't get full so fast because I wanted more. Probably the closest thing I've tasted to tacos on the street in Mexico. 

Would highly recommend the fish ( very fresh and light) and the pastor (if you're a fan of pineapples) and if not go for the pork. They even have there own salsa station with grilled jalape√±os to accompany your tacos for a complete bite. The shop is small and the interiors aren't of high class but who cares, cause the food is amazing. Number Juan in my books.",2,123
204,"Go for the Gusto! Superb service, great ambiance and fantastic food. 
Planned a small surprise birthday dinner for my sister. She listed this as one of her favourite eateries in the city so I arrived early with balloons. 
The front entrance staff were very kind to allow me to get a table for four ...with balloons LOL. 
Wait staff were equally friendly and very fast. Service was excellent. 
Food: my sister highly enjoys their kale salad. I thought it was great - massaged kale shredded with some sort of lemon vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan shavings. 
I spied the pizzas making their way to the tables of others so I went with a  prosciutto and arugula option. It was delicious. Perfect combination of flavours with a light, crispy crust. 

Definitely recommend for a nice, light meal with friends. A little loud for a date night but groups seem to like it (there's a second level and a patio during the summer months).",2,204
159,"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!",1,159
169,"I serendipitously passed by Quetzal in early August after dinner while walking along College with my girlfriend. The warm and dazzling interior immediately drew our attention. We were both full at that point, but we both agreed to return again soon, if at minimum to experience the stunning interior architecture.

The next day, my girlfriend returned to Montreal, where she would be based until late September, and I was left longing to try Quetzal. One week later, I found myself in the College St area again, visiting an old friend. Like any proper foodie boyfriend, I couldn't resist temptation, and ventured into Quetzal that night with my friend instead. Was it worth it to forsake my better half and visit Quetzal without her to satisfy my craving? I'd say yes. :-)

I could write paragraphs about Quetzal's beautiful interior design, but a picture is worth a thousand words - so perhaps you should review the photos. The owners of Quetzal did not cut any corners when designing the restaurant. Their use of curved walls, diffused lighting and an open-concept kitchen made an otherwise tight and low-ceiling restaurant feel very spacious. The area was very warm and inviting, and elegantly set the mood for dinner. And trust me, the design was justification enough for visiting. 

The service was also among the best I've  experienced in Toronto - a city whose servers I too often find rude or complacent. Subtle behaviors by the waiters demonstrated Quetzal's commitment to great service. For example, shortly after my friend went to the restroom, a waiter took the care to refold my friends linen napkin. Another example was when I flagged a waiter down about a broken soap dispenser in the men's washroom, and a worker was brought nearly immediately to fix the contraption. Above all, the servers were very friendly and helpful at every interaction. The restaurant was adequately (if not over-) staffed, and at the end of the day, an experienced and friendly restaurant staff is a large part of what any restaurant bill *should* be going towards.

And the food. It was delicious. Quetzal provides traditional Mexican fare, sometimes combined with Canadian accents. I tried the following: Ceviche Verde Mixto (a fresh combination of of scallop and halibut seasoned with a lime base), poblano+Silil pak+ajo salsas (three salsas with exquisite flavors that can be eaten with fresh restaurant made tortillas or reserved for a later course), chorizo toluqueno (three generous pieces of flavorful chorizo), pescado zarandeado (an entire butterflied fish, seasoned with red and green chili sauce), and pollito estillo sinaloa (butterflied wood oven cooked chicken served with luscious roasted mini potatoes and avocado sauce). 

One feedback about the food was that I found it a bit too subtle sometimes and a bit too unsubtle other times. For example, the ceviche tasted too limey, but the chili flavor on the fish or the avocado sauce on the chicken didn't pack enough punch. Another feedback is that some of our dishes were slightly overcooked. However, I believe that these dishes will be fine tuned over time, and I didn't consider these ""issues"" significant enough to stop me from enjoying the food. In fact, I look forward to returning to try the sweetbread, lamb and vegetable dishes that I was unable to try during my first visit.

Quetzal is an ambitious upscale Mexican restaurant venture that is sure to impress across a variety of dimensions - food, service and design. Quetzal gets it and does not compromise on experience. I recommend going with 3-4 friends and ordering a bunch of different plates to try a bit of each.",2,169
391,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!",1,391

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it.",1,622

537,"Decided to try this place since we've heard so many good things about it, and to see if its up there on my list of best beef noodle soups in Toronto. 

We ended up getting the mega beef noodle soup because it seemed like the best thing to share between two people. But honestly, if you were hungry enough you could probably finish it on your own. 

Noodles are hand pulled in store, and you can choose the lenght/thickness or style you wanted your noodles to be. We opted for the round thin noodles. The broth is nice and light but it still has body. You can really taste the beefiness. The parsley and green onion help cut through the rich soup. One of my favourite things here actually was not part of the noodle itself. But rather it was the chilli oil. The chilli oil was delicious and I probably finished half of the container by myself. 

Honestly overall it was pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind. Solid beef noodle soup and awesome hand pulled noodles. 10/10 would come again.",2,537

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet.",1,51

150,"First time at Cinco and we were not disappointed. Lots of great things on the menu, so we will definitely be coming back to try more. Also, they have a great salsa bar with a variety of options worth trying. Lively atmosphere, but the service was just a bit slow.
For this first visit, we started with the lime margaritas (FYI that these are frozen, but very good) and the chicken taquitos (good; the shells felt a little tough but all the fresh toppings made up for it).
Then we got the Pollo con mole gourmet taco (very good!) and the enchiladas (3 per order, we couldn't finish it). Trying a different salsa with each bite gives each a unique flavour profile. The morita salsa was my favourite, and the jerk flavoured one is good too.

They also do brunch, and the menu says their cocktail menu is coming.",2,150
625,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0,625
569,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish.",1,569
182,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!",0,182
274,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!",0,274
258,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white d√©cor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the d√©cor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1,258

505,"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings.",1,505
554,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1,554
383,"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you'd think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was really looking forward to finding a staple Italian restaurant nearby, but with all the other Italian restaurants in the area, I can't really think of any reason, why we'd come back to Taverna Mercatto.",0,383
355,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!",1,355
575,"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!",1,575
623,"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!",2,623
95,"We ordered takeout from here over the weekend and the food was okay. I would consider it mediocre but for the low price of $3-4 per taco you can't really complain. 

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!",1,95

154,"What a fun little place!!! They have an absolutely beautiful outdoor seating area. I can't think of an ambience much better than sitting outside here on a summer night with a light breeze. Definitely the cutest place in the Distillery District based on just walking around and checking everything out.

The food: Is it overpriced? Absolutely. But I was very pleasantly surprised by its quality and I'm sure you can't get anything cheap in this area. Obviously this isn't some hole in the wall taquer√≠a, but for the kind of place this is, the al pastor tacos were great. Super flavorful and tons of pineapple. Much better than whaf I expected. We also ordered chips and guac for the table. There was plenty of guac but an almost laughably small amount of chips, so probably not worth the cost but still good. And of course we enjoyed everything a little more when they brought out our margarita pitcher...

If I'm ever back in Toronto I'd totally come back here. Whether you're coming for dinner or just to grab some drinks and some Instagram pics, this is a good spot.",2,154
143,"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1,143
58,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings.",1,58
107,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this.",0,107
553,"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up. 

The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight. 

The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though. 

They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value. 

If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable.",1,553
14,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15.",0,14
662,"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish",1,662
352,"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered.",0,352
549,Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.,0,549

It's a bit hidden, you have to go up some narrow stairs to reach the restaurant. The decor is pretty plain but it's not disgusting inside like some other hole-in-the-walls.

I always get the baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce here. The flavours are so good, the calamari in it is so crispy even when doused in the sauce. Come here with a few friends and try a bit of everything if you can. Or just come back as often as you can!",2,495
472,"Winterlicious 2020 lunch $33

App: Miku zen (tofu salad, tuna sashimi, fried scallop, truffle chicken) 

Main: Aburi sushi plate (5 psc - aburi salmon, aburi Saba, coal harbour roll, aburi bincho nigiri, aburi ebi) 

Dessert: Green tea opera (cake and ice cream)

I've been to miku many times during the licious season and having tried both the lunch and dinner menu... I MUCH prefer the LUNCH over the dinner.  There are more variety in terms of the apps since I get to try 4 things! On top of that, the dessert is about the same for lunch and dinner. The difference would be portions in terms of main course. For the lunch menu, you only get 5 pieces of sushi which is def not filling for everyone, whereas for dinner you can choose to get the 5 pieces for app and have steak or what not for the main. However, I much prefer the MIKU ZEN for apps and I get a little taste of MIKU's aburi sushi. I came out full tho but I can't speak for everyone since we all eat diff portions.

All courses were fantastic - taste and presentation are ALL on point. However, as mentioned before, portion for the main is small... so not everyone will be able to get full from that. But I was VERY satisfied with all 3 meals and this is why I KEEP coming back to MIKU. 

Staff was friendly and welcoming. I also love the interior design of Miku - very bright and lively! Miku has ALWAYS been my staple in terms of the licious selection across Toronto. Looking forward to summerlicious 2020 at MIKU!!",2,472
130,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok.",1,130

421,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal.",1,421
187,"Didn't expect much going into the restaurant but was quite surprised by how roomy it is inside. They can easily host parties with reservations.

597,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0,597
131,"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city.",2,131
658,"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat. 

We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil. 

For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price. 

Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.

I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating.",1,658

I'm super into middle eastern cuisine, and this is definitely not what you'd expect.

If I'm judging it based on middle eastern influenced cuisine, I'd say I loved it.

The menu was a mish mash of the best bits of a few middle eastern countries put together with some interesting cocktails and great presentation.

The portions are tiny, but for me that was great because I got to really try out a ton of their menu.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

295,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!",1,295
349,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake.

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?",1,651

Couldn't secure a reservation during my visit to Toronto but they take walk-ins so that's what I did. The wait for a party of 2 on the evening (the day after new year) was estimated to be about 20 minutes but we were seated before that. 

For drinks I had the regular Thai tea and then later an alcohol version of Thai tea  featuring vodka (yea, you read that right!! IT was rather tasty!)

The spring rolls and tom yum soup were  our appetizers of choice. The rolls were fried with cabbage and mushrooms inside. The soup served with mushrooms and shrimp was flavorful and well balanced.

The khao soi and pad krapow were our entr√©es of choice. The pad krapow came out with the fried egg and rice and tasted as it should. And khao soi was truly excellent. The curry was  possibly one the best I've tasted .

Overall, Pai lived up to my expectations and to it's name. By the time we walked out, there was a line of people waiting to be seated that went around the block it seemed and when I saw that, I nodded in agreement. Worth the wait!",2,426

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

Not craving a bahn mi, I decided to go on yelp to find something small that would temporarily fill me up before dinner at 7PM. First thing that popped up for me was this place. I noticed that the prices were relativelyo inexpensive so I was skeptical on the taste. How often do you get to pay less for good food?!?

It was a juicy, delicious, tasteful, and mouth watering soup dumpling I have ever tasted. It was just so perfect. I regret not ordering more!! My friend ordered the steamed mini soup dumpling and we traded one of the soup dumplings with each other. She also LOVED the pan fried mini soup dumpling!

The place was spacious but didn't have that many seats. Since we got there early-ish, there were enough seats for us.

This is a good place for a quick bite! Will most definitely come back here when I visit Toronto again!",2,533
515,"A friend of mine invited me to have dinner here as we wanted to experience a night out in Toronto's China town. 

We ordered the Hot and Sour soup as the starting dish. The medium size was more than enough to offer two servings to four adult males with big appetites. 

Followed by a full order of the roasted duck that came in two varieties, traditional BBQ duck breast and duck chop suey. They even provided thin dumpling wraps that made it easier to eat the duck. 

The Chinese Broccoli and Salted Fish Fried Rice were the last two items in our order. The rice dish was perfectly seasoned and the salt did not over power the dish at all. 

This restaurant is perfect for a quick meal at a reasonable price right in the heart of Toronto's iconic Chinatown.",2,515

654,"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again.",1,654
481,"Stopped by this restaurant with my parents for nostalgic reasons. They both raved about it being the best place for noodles since they were in high school. They said it's one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can't exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!",2,481

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme br√ªl√©e, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water.",1,408
203,"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/",1,203

10,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

77,"This place is great! I've been craving tacos for a long time and decided to check this restaurant out. It was a small and cozy restaurant with great decorations. 

I got the chicken, the beef, and the pork tacos. I got a number and they brought the tacos out to me. They were seriously filled with meats and stuffings! I don't think I've ever had a taco that had so much filling. While I usually get 4 tacos, 3 tacos here were definitely enough to fill me up. 

I'll definitely be coming back here to try out all their other flavours or to grab a quick bite.",2,77
184,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!",0,184
268,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!",1,268
663,"Sooooooo. Good. No joke, I visited this restaurant and came back for more only 2 days later.

I am so glad that regional Chinese cuisine is exploding onto Toronto's food scene. Don't get me wrong, dim sum is alright, but biang biang noodles are where it's at.

And they are so damn good here. Thick handmade noodles, enveloped in warm sweet and savoury sauce, and served with a generous variety of toppings -- it's just so comforting. I inhaled everything on my plate in record time. I think the $13.99 price point is fair.

The other standout for me was the Shuan Platter ($12.99). It's an appetizer sampler with enoki mushrooms, tofu sheets, and honeycomb tripe doused in chili sesame sauce. Just thinking about the tripe makes my mouth water -- the soft, chewy tripe was the perfect vessel for soaking up the rich sauce. Umami galore.

Pretty much everything else we've tried so far has been delicious, except perhaps the shredded potato salad ($5.99, not pictured). It was a little too vinegary and not spicy enough for my taste, but still complemented the Jia Mo well.

The ambiance is definitely fast-paced during busy prime hours, so come during off peak periods (before 6 pm, after 8:30 pm) to skip the lineups. Service is quite good and, unlike similar restaurants, the servers speak fluent English.

Can't get enough of this place! Try it and thank me later.",2,663
628,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.",0,628
567,We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.,0,567
677,"I went to Blooming Orchid restaurant for some takeout food. Blooming Orchid is an Asian fusion restaurant that replaced Duckee restaurant. The staff was very friendly. It took a long time to order as the menu is very cluttered and confusing. They have Chinese food, sushi, dim sum, etc. Normally when a restaurant have so many choices, the food is terrible. The prices were pretty high as their dim sum dishes cost 5 dollars a plate.

I ordered the dim sum no.1 platter which has steamed spinach hai gow, shrimp hai gow, and fried shrimp rolls. I also ordered the salmon rolls. To my great surprise, the food was very good. The fried shrimp rolls were great as it wasn't overcooked. The salmon rolls were also very good.

Would I go back? Sure as the food was very good.",2,677
62,"My friends and I (6+ people) came on a Tuesday for the Tuesday special where you get 8 hardshell tacos to share. My friends ordered the other tacos and really liked the 'In Cod We Trust' taco. We also had quesadillas, corn, and churros (really delicious btw, I highly recommend). I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable. Being a large group, we were not notified about the automatic gratuity until we asked for the bill at the end.",1,62
177,"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!",1,177
650,"Quick lunch today while trying to kill some time. I don't know why I've been craving BBQ pork lately, I'm assuming this is what pregnant women go through. I yelped this spot and was thrilled it had 4.5 stars.
This place is takeout only, there is no room to barely stand inside. Plan on eating in your car or sneaking a table in the food court.  You better not stutter when ordering because the cashier is all about fast efficient ordering.  
I'm giving a one star penalty because they don't offer duck in any of the combos. They only offer half duck minimum orders.  I was super bummed. I ended up ordering BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken with an absurd amount of green onions sauce. It sure hit the spot.  I was super jealous of my brother's roast pork order.  The skin was perfect. 10/10. The meat was so moist. For sure next time I'm going to order that.",2,650
324,"I have a vague memory from 2009 of coming to an Italian place in this location, but on a rainy day it was empty.  I remembered it as being pretty decent and thought, hey this place seems like it's in the same spot so it must be the same place!

First off, it was packed at 7pm on a Friday but my dad and I were able to get the perfect table out on the front patio.  Our waitress was really nice and, although she had a lot of tables she was looking after, made good recommendations.

By far the favorite thing I ate here was the warm mushroom arugula salad, which was recommended to us by our waitress (instead of the caprese salad).  It was so good that I'm still dreaming about it today.  The mushrooms were salty and lemony and they coated the greens and warmed them up nicely.

For our entree, we decided to split a pasta and a pizza.  Note from me: skip the pizza!  Our ""marguerite"" pizza was just a very cheesy mess.  It tasted better next day.  It was nothing like a pizza marguerite (and does not look like the ones posted previously on yelp).  The pasta we had was one of the special ones, and I can't remember the name.  Kind of like half moon raviolis.  It was good, but man the sauce was great!  Next time I'd say get an appetizer and then maybe 2 pastas to split ... but skip the pizza for sure.

All in all, really pleasant experience.  Oh, and I had a tiramisu to go.  Was super good.  Only thing I remember not liking about my dining experience (besides the pizza) was the fact that the napkins were paper.",2,324
502,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1,502
592,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0,592
312,"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5.",1,312
471,"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price.",0,471
29,"I really want to write a nicer review for this place because the food is amazing. And $2.50 fish tacos cannot be beat. The sign advertising said fish tacos is what reeled us in. 

But the service was just abysmal. 

My husband and I were eating around Toronto, so we were ordering small plates everywhere we went so we could get the best of all worlds. We ordered their three for $10 tacos (chicken, pork, and beef) and an extra fish taco for $2.50. All the tacos were amazing, the pork being our favourite and the beef, although good, was our least favourite (it was a bit dry). However, the server seemed annoyed that the two of us were ordering so little. We weren't offered side plates to share the tacos, so they were dripping everywhere and we struggled not to make a mess. We were never offered any water and their sauces were very spicy. Thankfully we had our own. And the thing that irked me most was that we were overcharged $1.50 for our tacos. They write the receipts by hand and were originally charged $10 for the three tacos, but they scratched that out and wrote $11.50. Not a huge deal. I asked why we were overcharged and the server said it's because we mixed and matched our tacos. She was kind of rude when I asked. But all the other reviews seem like it's $10 for three tacos regardless of mixing them up. I think they were mad we took up a table and tried to make it up in other ways. I couldn't care less about $1.50, but I don't like shady business practices.",0,29

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating!

The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‚Äç it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch.

We ordered the share platter app, I had the mushroom pasta and my husband had the salmon pasta. For dessert we had the cannoli and melted lava cake with a latte.

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0,429

There was a huge variety of options to order and al for a fair price however there was a huge lack of flavour in anything you ate until you added sauces from their sauce bar(which was great). I felt like I was getting grilled vegetables flavoured with salt and wrapped in a tortilla. 

My stars are really going towards the tomatillo sauce which really saved the day.",1,6

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second.

470,"Winterlicious Dinner Review $53

Finally got to try Miku for their winterlicious dinner menu. For $53 you got an appetizer, a main and a dessert option.

Appetizer:
Sushi Sampler - included some pressed sushi's (shrimp and salmon), two nigiris (shrimp and sea bream), and two pieces of rolls (spicy red tuna and a white tuna one). The sample was decent tasting. My favourites were the two nigiri pieces as they were very fresh and flavorful. The pressed sushi ones were okay as well and provided a more 'fusion' type sushi taste. My least favourite was the rolls. They tasted dry and bland to the point that it was hard to tell what you were sampling. 

Main / Entree: 
Sablefish and Lobster Ravioli with eggplant, mushrooms and romanesco. 

I really enjoyed this entree. I though the sablefish was marinated and cooked perfectly. It was a perfect balance of sweetness and melt in your mouth smoothness. The lobster ravioli and cream sauce was amazing as well. You could really see and taste the quality ingredients that went into the ravioli with lobster meat on every bite. The accompanying vegetables were a little disappointing and very bland tasting. I felt like the romanesco and mushrooms were just blanched with hot water with no seasoning. It didn't really add to the dish, if anything took away from the other two tasty items. 

Dessert: 
Green Tea Opera Cake with Green Tea Gelato

The dessert tasted standard. I heard a lot of great things about this cake and was super excited to try it, but perhaps it was overhyped. I felt the cake part (chocolate ganache) overpowered the green tea flavour as opposed to complimenting it. But, the gelato was very delicious and pungent, which I enjoyed.

The service was great as usual. My only complaint was the fact that the women's bathroom always seems to be in disarray. I think more attention needs to be paid to it for this type of restaurant that thrives in the 'experience'. One stall was broken and there was toilet paper everywhere on the floor. 

Overall, I felt that the food was decent, but perhaps the quality is not as high when it is Winterlicious? Mop",1,470
319,"Wow, gotta say I'm impressed with the food here (note: I've only tried their food through foodora so this review will be based solely on their food quality)! We ordered around 15 dishes from Fusaro's for the office - a slew of pizzas, pastas, paninis, salads, and soups. 

I ordered the primavera pasta with the chicken add-on and I don't want to brag or anything, but my dish looked the most appetizing out of everyone's. The vegetables (zucchini, red pepper, broccoli, spinach) tasted really fresh and the chicken is real chunks of chicken which is quite worth the addon IMO. The sauce has a good flavour as well, but wasn't a fan of it being on the runny side. They also added a container of parmesan to sprinkle on top of your pasta, which was a nice touch.

Minus one star because the bread that came with the pasta did not come with any olive oil or butter, which makes all the difference to me.",2,319
518,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either.",1,518
510,"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service.",1,510
32,"Decided to check this out from Yelp recommendations. When I arrived inside the front door, was greeted right away by the super friendly staff. We proceeded in the back for dining in. The menu had a wide assortment of tacos to choose from, a couple drink options and guacamole. I ordered the quesadillas, the shrimp taco, carnitas and fish taco. Overall the taste of each of the tacos were great, loaded with flavor! The quesadillas was more different then your normal quesadillas, it was quite doughy but was oozing with cheese. I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who's looking for some quick tacos and a more quiet atmosphere.",2,32
643,Social distancing is in effect.  If I remember correctly you can't go inside the shop without wearing a mask.  People were lining up patiently today near 4:30 this afternoon.  The roast pork all gone.  Grabbed a duck.,2,643
584,"Pros: quick service, nice staff, great (fresh) ramen noodles 
Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles. She loved her beef ramen so maybe that helps someone out there",1,584
219,"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there.",0,219
217,"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem.",1,217
425,"Went on a Sunday night and there was already a line. We got a table for two within five minutes. For a Thai restaurant, I would have to say this place has an unusual ambience -- it's dimly lit with popular North American songs blasting on speakers throughout the restaurant, and can be quite loud. There is also a full bar here if that's your thing.

All in all, the food was great. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan 'In a Coconut' is a green curry dish served with rice and extra green curry in a bowl on the side (the waiter said it was because it can't all fit in the coconut). It is a dish more on the spicy side, but I would say it's still manageable. The coconut really gives this dish some character, and you can also scoop out some coconut meat with your spoon to eat as well. You can choose between chicken, beef, dish, or tofu & veggies.

Khao Soi is also a curry dish but it is a coconut curry dish. It is more sweet than spicy but still has a kick of spice to it. I like the combination of egg noodles and crunchy noodles. We got braised beef chunks (like the ones you put in beef stew), but you can choose between chicken or beef. I thought this dish might be overhyped when I was reading Yelp reviews prior to coming here, but it really is worth the hype.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to have Thai food in Toronto. I'll definitely be back again.",2,425
508,"Visited on a quiet Monday evening, service was incredibly fast and our server was very friendly. This place does not take credit/debit! Cash only! We ordered the pork and chives pan fried  dumplings and they were pretty good! Nothing special, just your average pan fried dumpling. Fair price - $10 for 12.",2,508
116,"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection.",0,116
73,"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos.",1,73
531,"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch. 

They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer. 

The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross.",1,531
417,"Giulietta has been high on my to-do list because I hear about it everywhere. Not only am I an avid fan of Top Chef Canada, where in season one Executive Chef Rob Rossi was the runner-up (he was my favourite on the show and should've won!) but the hype is real about this place in general. enRoute magazine chose them as #5 on Canada's Best New Restaurants 2018 list. Toronto Life has them on two lists; #33 on The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 and #3 on The Best New Restaurants 2019. And of course, the biggest of them all, they've landed at #9 on Canada's 100 Best Restaurants 2019. It has all certainly been more than enough to catch my attention. Giulietta (pronounced Julietta) is an Italian restaurant set on making classic dishes fresh and new again. And I was lucky enough to pay them a visit on a Saturday evening for my anniversary, no less.

The outside of this Little Italy-adjacent restaurant is fairly unassuming, however the inside is very sharp. A reservation is almost always a must. A lot of care and attention has gone into the stylish design of the space, creating a polished atmosphere. Muted tones are accented with copper metallics, with just a little bit of exposed brick for good measure. I was impressed by the stunning glass walk-in pantry placed right in the middle of the room. This truly added a market-quality feeling to the space and certainly invoked a certain Italian vibe. I also noted the various bar carts around the room, stocked full with gleaming bottles and glasses. The room feels quite adult and a little like an escape to Europe.

Seated at our cozy table for two, I eyed up the bustling activity in the open kitchen. Chef Rob Rossi himself did not appear to be present on this evening. Next, a thorough examination of the cutlery was in order. This might be one of the best little features to discover at Giulietta - many of the mismatched vintage flatwear are engraved with all sorts of adorable little sayings. I had a fork which read ""me too"" and an appropriately-printed spoon that said ""spoon me."" I absolutely loved this whimsical touch. Our friendly hostess and server wished us a happy anniversary repeatedly, which was incredibly sweet. I appreciated that there was no pretension to be found whatsoever, but on the other hand, I found the service almost slightly too casual. I liked that our server was quite laid-back but I found her delivery of information somewhat unpolished for a restaurant of this caliber. We were offered complimentary sparkling or still water to drink.

I was ready for a cocktail and easily selected the Giulietta Spritz (Quaglia berto aperitivo, prosecco & soda - $15.00) with the assumption that any signature drink has gotta be good. Made with a classic Italian aperitif, I loved the light, fresh bitterness. The essence was reminiscent of chinotto to me - one of my favourite flavours to accompany Italian food. The olive garnish was the perfect touch and the fact that I was provided with a small gold-rimmed dish for the pit was even better. Saluti!

The copper-embossed menu is one page long with well-laid out sections. It reads as an Italian meal should be consumed; with Primi, Secondi, and Contorni columns. Our server was helpful in suggesting some of the restaurant's top plates and my husband and I did our best to make well-rounded selections, attempting to taste as much variety as possible. Starting with the Spuntini (snacks) section, the Olive all' Ascolana (Fried Castelvetrano olives wrapped with sausage‚Äã - $9.00) seemed like an obvious choice. This little dish was unexpected. I've never tried a sausage-wrapped olive before and I was here for it. Dusted with Pecorino, these savoury-briny bites were fried to perfection and incredibly unique.

From the same section, we also chose the Burrata Pugliese (Italian Burrata, rhubarb marmellata, gnocco fritto, black pepper &amp; basil - $27.00). It was easy to be enticed by the grilled octopus, but I had a good feeling about this one. I mean, gnocco fritto is always a major selling point in my book. Doesn't everyone love fried pillows of happiness? Burrata is a fresh Italian cow milk cheese made from mozzarella and cream. The result is an ultra-soft, practically spreadable cheese that tastes like heaven when seasoned with a bit of olive oil and salt. The gnocco fritto served as a vessel for the Burrata and a bit of rhubarb jam on top added a delightful tart sweetness. This is the perfect example of a plate that is so simple, and yet so perfect. I think that this dish was our favourite of the entire meal.

Moving to the Primi (first) section, it was time to get things going for real. All four pasta dishes on offer sounded amazing, but the Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe (Traditional long Roman pasta, kampot black pepper &amp; Pecorino - $23.00) had to be the one. My husband and I adored this dish on our trip to Rome a few years ago and have a definite soft spot for it. An extremely simple pasta, it basically just involves cheese and pe",2,417
550,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0,550
460,"Still feeling very content from my dinner here last night.. the curry and Thai iced tea were so yummy!! 

I came with a friend on a Friday at 5:30. We were seated right away, having to share a long table with multiple pairs of people. Most of their seating consists of bigger tables so pairs needed to sit with other pairs pretty closely, which can be a bit uncomfortable for some, but as long as the food was good it wasn't an issue for me. 

I order the chicken Khao soi (mild spice) and a thai iced tea. I really enjoyed both. The khao soi was very tasty and flavourful, and the crunch was nice. I was surprised that the curry was pretty spicy though, considering I ordered mild. I was glad I didn't opt for anything spicier or else I probably would have suffered. My advice is to go for a lower level of spice because it is pretty strong, and you can always ask them to add more later. The lady beside me got the same thing but with medium spice and was regretting that decision. The Thai iced tea was the perfect cherry on top to accompany the spicy taste of the curry. Super refreshing and thirst quenching. 

It was notable that the pricing here is a bit steeper than what I'm used to for Thai food, but it's what you can expect when downtown. I'm also still dreaming about that khao soi and Thai iced tea so it was pretty worth it all in all.",2,460
610,"We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table.",1,610
665,"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0,665
81,"Initially seen this restaurant off someone's Instagram, and wanted to visit. if you are looking for a vibe with good food this is a great spot. 

They have lunch special, my order was as followed:
Mexican Street Corn - fantastic !
Carne Asada & Achiote chicken tacos - great!
Peanut Butter Cookie I believe it was called - okay

Overall my experince here was very chill and enjoyable. Food was very good. Would recommend for nice chill day/night out.",2,81
209,"What a fantastic place! A hidden gem at that! We had reservations and once we arrived we were immediately seated upstairs in a dim area lit with candles. Our server was lovely and described the specials and menu in detail. I went with the Pappardelle Dei Castelli and Minestrone soup. We were brought some fresh bread and olive oil which was amazing. 

My soup was amazing. Not over done and was tasty. The entree was perfection. You can tell the noodles are homemade and wow that sauce was amazing- I opted for butter cream sauce versus the wine sauce that is typically included. Glad I went this route!! 

We had to try some dessert too so we all split the Gelato Affogato and Devils Chocolate Gelati. Both were satisfying and presented nicely. 

Love this intimate establishment and will definately be back!",2,209
4,"I've been duped by yelp reviews!! We were given recommendations for this place as a great lunch spot which was super cute inside and patio area was so inviting. The stars were for the decor and the one dish! 

Food we ordered:
Chile Rellenos- with rice and black beans- this was the star dish for sure, two large chille rellenos and delicious rice. Sauce was tasty as well. 

Guacamole- prepared guacamole probably mixed with fresh avocado, you can just tell it's from a bag because it's watery instead of creamy. Not special at all

Grilled fish tacos- this is so upsetting, they said it was bass, well it's not. If it was it's the mushiest bass I've ever eaten. Three little tacos that that hid the tiny piece of fish for $19 bucks! Sad don't get this

So disappointed",1,4
342,"Came here based on all the rave reviews and it lived up to the hype.

We started off with the muscles in white wine sauce which were really simple but tasty, and it's perfect for dipping your bread in too. For mains, I got the Giovanni pizza, and my friend got the Tasca. Of the two, I much preferred the Tasca. It's a pasta filled with mushrooms, spinach and brie & ricotta cheese.  The ros√© sauce it is served with is delicious too.

Although the pizza was good - lots of flavourful toppings and really filling (I could only eat half) - I found it a little too salty and the crust was a bit too dense for my liking. Next time I visit I'd definitely get a pasta dish.

The atmosphere inside is nice - it could work for something classy but also something casual as well. There is also a bar in the middle of the restaurant so if you want to just come in and have a drink you can do that as well. The service was fast and all the staff were very polite.",2,342
334,"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!",2,334
183,"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong.",1,183
564,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1,564
42,Their margaritas are excellent but their tacos aren't as good as they used to be. They are very simple - which isn't a bad thing *if* the few ingredients used standout and are prepared well. The pork was dry and the overall taco was flat - it didn't have the bright acidic flavours or freshness that I love in a taco.  The fish was tender but the chipotle sauce was overwhelming and I couldn't taste much beyond that. The queso fundido with mushrooms and onions was delicious and flavourful - it reminded me of French Onion soup. This place used to have delicious tacos years ago- hopefully I feel the same way about it soon.,1,42

516,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1,516
172,"The place is a small take away joint near Ryerson University, a one amongst many others serving different cuisines. It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor.",1,172
490,"[4.5/5 STARS] TLDR: HUGE FAN! My boyfriend brought me here for our one year anniversary dinner. Fave thing I ate here was the deep fried octopus tacos. The jicama shell was the most interesting take on a taco shell I've ever had. 

We started off with some house cocktails. I one that tasted like gin and he got the one with scotch. They were okay. 

The food on the other hand. Delicious! We couldn't decide which dishes to try, the waitresses and waiters were really helpful they suggested the tasting menu which is $68/person and made up of 5 courses of the Dailo's ""greatest hits"" - popular items on and off the menu. Probably the best decision we made. We made sure they knew my dietary restrictions and we were good to go!

They started us off with two amuse-bouche's which was a like a yam dressed in sake. So good! Next course was the Crispy Octopus Tacos (my fave!!!) and Pomelo Betel Leaf. I love the freshness of the lemon grass and the contrast with textures from the nut crumble. Third course was an carnita empanada with satay sauce (not on their current menu) and this tofu tomato salad that tasted like a play on a dairy-free (no mozzarella) caprese salad. The dough for the empanada was sweeter than i was used to but the sauce was so savoury! It made the dish for me! The tofu in the salad was prepared in a way to almost taste like the texture of cheese. It was very interesting and tasty as well. Fourth course we were served their Ontario Pea Dumplings (with truffles) - so rich so heavy so savoury very yummy - and their Hakka Brown Wontons. The sauce with the almond crumble on the wontons was to die for! The wontons themselves tasted so homey. I loved it. Lastly our fifth course was the lamb and sticky rice dish that came with a slaw (so good!!!) and the beet coconut curry dish. By the time I was done with the huge piece of lamb I didn't even have enough room to really enjoy the beet coconut curry. I liked them both though. They finished us off with a ginger sorbet palette cleanser. It was a lot of food for $68/person. I think if you have an appetite this is a great value for the quality of food you get. 

The only criticism I had was that at the end of the meal everything was starting to taste like betel leaf - that minty peppery taste - they had used it chopped up in most of the dishes they served us. The dishes on it's own with the betel leaf were delicious if we ordered that solely, but as a tasting menu, it was sort of overplayed all together.",2,490
331,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards.",0,331
474,"Definitely a bougie experience that was unlike any other! Yes, the prices are quite expensive, but the service is phenomenal. We sat in the piano lounge, and were definitely entertained by that night's performer. We were seated in the corner, along the couch - the sofa seats weren't particularly comfortable for dinner (they sank in quite a bit), but it added to the fine-dining atmosphere. The servers were also very kind and accommodated all dietary preferences (we had one vegetarian with us, and they would bring special orders to accommodate his restrictions, such as baguette with balsamic and olive oil to replace the popovers).

Each table is served complimentary popovers, one for each diner, topped with a thin layer of white cheddar cheese and served with roasted garlic butter. These legendary popovers are incredibly airy and light - we had to restrain ourselves from indulging on them in fear of spoiling our appetites for the mains. I preferred the harder shell of the popovers, though the inside is very buttery and rich. The garlic butter is quite flavourful, so take care not to add too much and overpower the bread!

Oyster rockefeller:
My colleague put in an order for this appetizer, thinking they were your normal raw shucked oysters, and couldn't hide his shock when they came topped with a decadent, creamy, cheesy mixture. There was an interesting meatball nestled on top of the sauce. The oysters were quite rich, though I can't say I was the biggest fan.

Caesar salad: 
We then ordered three sets of Jacob's famous caesar salad to be prepared beside the table. I was pleasantly surprised when the server came to the table and asked for everyone's personal preferences for their salad order (e.g., whether cheese or anchovies are okay, etc.). She then made the dressing on the spot - I saw her separate three egg yolks, then whisk thoroughly and combine with freshly cracked pepper, cheese, and a generous amount of olive oil. She then served each plate separately according to our liking - for instance, I didn't want additional cheese but chose to have an anchovy on top. I also noticed that she served me first, likely as I was the only female at the table. 

As it was made in real-time table-side, the Caesar salad was unbelievably fresh. The crunchy, leafy lettuce greens were evenly coated with the creamy dressing. While good, I found the salad to be on the spicy side. The pepper added quite a bit of kick, with a slight bitter aftertaste. The anchovy imparted a pleasant touch of umami, but I thought the bacon was far too salty. There were square chunks of the hard cured meat which, interestingly enough, strongly resembled Chinese cured sausage. 

The mains came next, served with an array of sauces (Argentinian chimichurri, Japanese citrus ponzu, a richer bacon & blue cheese) and salts (sea salt, regular salt, black lava salt). I preferred the ponzu, though the chimichurri was also nice, as well as the variety of salts. It's amazing what a simple seasoning can do to enhance the taste of the steak!

Queensland tenderloin wagyu:
This steak was honestly very tender and super buttery. I barely had to chew; the meat would give to a slight push of my tongue and melt in my mouth. I've had wagyu beef before, but often more thinly sliced and prepared on a Japanese grill. It was my first time with a meaty seared piece prepared medium rare, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Definitely my favourite cute of the night!

Creekstone T-bone:
I didn't have a good experience with this steak. My piece was actually terrible - it was near the edge, and was overcooked to the point where the meat proteins resembled tough pulled brisket. There was also a small amount of fat/gristle that made my mouth seize up. It wasn't a pleasant feeling, and I was very disappointed.

Striploin:
This was a leaner cut of meat compared to the wagyu, though not as tough as the T-bone. Like the others, it was grilled to a perfect medium-rare, with rich and buttery flavours. 

We also ordered a variety of sides to accompany our mains. The duck fat french fried potatoes had a very meaty flavour, and was a great carb to complement our otherwise protein-heavy meal. The mushrooms, carrots, and asparagus were all drenched in butter - this meal was definitely not for the faint-hearted! I was definitely very full and stuffed by the end, and regrettably could not order dessert. 

The bill came with some small shortbread bites, a light sweet to signify the end of meal. We also received some massive breakfast muffins for the next day, a mix of coffee and chocolate filling. The meal was great, but alas, not perfect - perhaps my expectations were too high, but that one steak killed my vibe.",2,474
452,"Years ago, when Bang Bang first opened, I braved the cold to wait in an hour long line to get some Totaro ice cream in a bubble waffle cone. It was good, but nothing too memorable that I forgot about this place and moved onto other ice cream spots in the city.

Fast forward five years, after dinner at Mamakas, I decided to give Bang Bang another try. This time, the weather was just above freezing, but fortunately, there was no line up. 

I got a small cup of the burnt toffee flavour. Now this, was delicious. A sweet creamy base with bit of crunchy toffee topped with a toffee drizzle. I savoured every bite. It's been two weeks since I've had it and I'm still thinking about it.",2,452
144,"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this.

We had Barbacoa de Borrego and Chocinita Pibli, both were good but you only get tortillas, a very small cup of beans and pineapple salsa.  No rice.  Both dinners were appetizer sized and priced $18-$20 each. For starters we had guacamole sampler which was excellent but definitely overpriced @ $18.  

I would recommend this place but beware of portion size for the price you pay.",2,146
63,"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ...",1,63
346,"Finally made it to this place for a late lunch. Even though it was late lunch, this place is busy and bustling with people. 

Walked around 2nd floor and went to a pizza and pasta joint. Even though the place was busy, the servers moved fast to clean and set us up. 

Saw the menu and heard the special for the day. We got some fresh mozzarella, pasta dish (I didn't dare to try to butcher the name of the dish in front of the Italian server) and the pizza special (ate too fast and almost forgot to take a picture). 

Food came out quite fast, and mozzarella was fresh and light. Pasta was light, al dente and had the right flavour. Pizza was the Neapolitan style, tasty and did not feel heavy at all. 

I would rate the entire place a 3.5 stars, rounding up to a 4. It's quite good with service and food.",2,346
617,"This appears to be an old school family run Chinese restaurant. Great food crossed with a modest priority on establishment decor.

We had the spicy sliced chicken, pork with vegetables, won ton and hot and sour soup, beef fried rice.  Every dish was really really good. The spicy chicken was wicked spicy and was utterly fantastic!

The fellow waiting on use was confident, very nice and helpful.

Will be back when in the area.",2,617
71,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town.",1,71
477,"[Review was based on experience weeks ago]

This place is one of the first locations I have ever bookmarked on Yelp when I started my journey here. One time, my coworker asked me if there were any good places to eat for Chinese food and I remembered the amount of good reviews for this place and so I told him about it even though I did not have it yet. He told me the next day that he loved it! 

After about 4 years of this sitting in my bookmarks, it was time to try it out. It was busy during the time we went and so that fueled our appetites even more. We got the beef ho fun, wonton soup and shrimp fried rice. I was actually amazed because the food came out relatively fast and that it was sooooo yummy. I usually do not eat Chinese food outside but this one is 100% an exception. Good portions with also good prices, indeed. I would totally come back to eat the same delicious dishes again. I am salivating as I look back at these photos....",2,477
24,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back.",1,24
282,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts.",1,282

523,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried doughÁÇ∏‰∏§ËÇ†Á≤â: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0,523
437,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be.",0,437

132,"I'm a huge fan of Authentic tacos, and in many ways consider Tacos El Asadore the measure of quality tacos for Toronto. Don't anyone suggest Wilber's, except those hipster never been to Mexico wannabes. 

Anyway. This soot is true to Yelp tips, small setup inside a butcher shop. Likely more Mexican stream joint than butcher shop, given the sq footage, I'll bet they expand and take the whole place over soon. 

I went pretty safe, grabbed a couple steak tacos at $6 a piece. The corn tortilla was authentic and really good, while the meat was mildly seasoned and unfortunately a bit too full of gristle for my liking. Yes, glad I had a napkin. 

One thing I liked are the accessible condiments as wanted. Onions, cilantro, hot sauce and mild. All fresh, all good. Once you add everything and bite, you'll feel like you're warped to a small taqueria in Mexico. Well done. 

I'll be back, and ready to explore the wider offerings they have.",2,132

242,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit.",1,242
259,"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...

Pai is a trendy Thai restaurant located in downtown Toronto. It is one of the most popular spots in the city so you need to make a reservation in advance. It is busy and loud, and constantly has hip hop and pop music playing in the background. The majority of the guests are millennials so it might not be the best place for everyone.

The food is very good and very filling. I always order too much which is okay as the leftovers (excluding anything crispy) tend to travel well. There are a lot of menu options and you can't really go wrong with anything.

Highly recommended. I will be back soon. Four stars.",2,424

313,"This place is fantastic! It's a cafe atmosphere that I assume is similar to one in Italy. It's modern with an industrial feel. Tables are higher top and a bit difficult for an older person to reach easily but once seated it was very comfortable.  The kitchen is an open concept for everyone to view the cooks working at their craft. 

Everything is delicious and service is excellent. We started with a delicious non-bitter CafeAmericano! 
While waiting for the rest of our party we enjoyed a ricotta  filled cannoli that was garnished with a candied orange peel. The cannoli shell was very crisp and the ricotta was slightly sweetened. The addition of the candies orange zest improved and completed the melange of flavors. We also, ordered an anise flavored Pizzelle sandwich cookie that was filled with a chestnut cream ganache to share with everyone. It was enjoyed by all. 

Once our other friends joined us, we all ordered from the menu for breakfast / brunch. I ordered the Strapazzate (baked eggs, burrata and shaved black truffle), which was served with freshly toasted ciabatta bread with olive oil and a sprinkling of salt at an $18 price tag. Delicious!!! My husband ordered the Grande Colazione which was a fennel sausage, egg and peppronata plate at $16. The other diners ordered the Al Forno, a baked eggs, buffalo ricotta and pesto genovese dish at $14 and the Tigella a prosciutto cotto and truffled formaggio fresco with egg. This last one was served on a flat bun similar to a small english muffin. It was very small and wasn't satisfying for the diner and this was priced at $11.

It was as noisy as a sports bar and not a good place for chatting. My friend and I had to shout really loud at each other. I can't say I enjoyed the ambiance at all.

We ordered the fish salami platter to share, which came with squid ink bread. The bread looked interesting but taste was just average. For the salami, we both liked the octopus. The spicy flavoured pork blood salami was interesting to me too. 

For main, I had the duck pasta and my friend had the lobster pasta. It took us an hour to wait for the main dish though. We saw people sitting next to us got their food first when they came in later. The duck pasta was very chewy and very tasty (though a little bit salty). The duck had a tuna salad texture which was quite interesting. My friend enjoyed the lobster pasta in general but she didn't like the fact that the noodle being too thin and soft (it's personal preference, though I agree with her). The portion of the food was small but good enough to feed two small eaters.

In general, the food quality was good but missed the wow factor.  Service was average and it was a bit pricy for the overall experience. A 3.5 star rounded down. I will not consider coming back any time soon.",1,308

As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

Overhead and across from us the Japanese restaurant, Kimono, started it's rooftop terrace which turns into a club later in the evening. They started their house music.

Had it not been for our server (who was beyond funny and provided the best service), this would have been a 3 star review. Our party appreciates elevated service when it comes to  upscale dining facilities with premium prices, and she absolutely nailed it.

We started off with cocktails, and the nightingale sour was the clear winner among the round we ordered. It's the perfect cocktail to quench your thirst, with sweet and floral notes (coming from the peach and orange blossom). We also tried the marrakesh garden which was also refreshing, but forgettable.

For our appetizers and mains, we ordered:

Turkish manti dumplings - eggplant dumplings drizzled with a super rich yogurt sauce. Highly recommend.

Fig salad - heavy orange blossom notes on this refreshing and delicate salad. It's almost too beautiful to eat, but safe to say this was gone in a jiff.

Black truffle pide - this flatbread was nothing spectacular. To be frank, I am not so much a truffle lover, but my truffle-loving friends agreed this was a simple dish not worth swooning over.

Grilled whole branzino - though the flavours were great - smoky and lemon-y - the branzino was overdone. It was hard to justify the $39 price tag on this one.

Persian kale rice - this was an overwhelming portion for 2-3 people (which is not a bad thing!). I appreciated the crunch from the fragrant rice and lentils, but this again is a dish not worth swooning over.

Roasted brussel sprouts - our sprouts came out pretty burnt which was disappointing. Any flavours from the halloumi, tahini, and yogurt were missed due to the charred leaves.",2,449

From the moment you walk into the restaurant, Hands down quetzals interior design is beautiful. The sloped ceiling creates an inviting appearance to the dining room and the open fires at the back, fill the space with a smell that instantly indicated that I was in the right place. We ordered many tastes from the menu. We started with several veggie dishes including the grilled asparagus, green salad and grilled runner beans. The favourite from the veggie dishes were the runner beans. They have a similar bite to cactus without the slimey texture. The addition of coconut and cotija cheese added unique flavours and textures to the earthy veggies. The restaurant makes its own masa based dishes and we opted for the Mamelas and the empanada. Both dishes were gluten free and delicious. The mamelas were a flavour bomb with trumpet mushrooms and a cheese sauce. For meat, we had the chorizo, steak and sweet breads. To be honest, the steak was a bit chewy and not a favourite of the group. The sweet breads however, were unreal. I have never had sweet breads before and the way that they were prepared at quetzal proved just how delicious a organ meat can be. For dessert we had the avocado ice cream with GRASSHOPPERS and a passion fruit mousse. I never thought I would enjoy grasshoppers but they truly added the most unique texture in contrast to the smooth creamy ice cream.

538,"Tiny tiny place and hot as heckkkk.

They have fans running, but with an open kitchen, hot soup as their main sell, and small space with filled up seats of human body heat... it is HOT inside.

Service is overall good, but you do have to flag down the servers as they are busy. No biggie though since the place is so small, you don't have to try hard to get their attention. 

Boyfriend and I ordered the Mega beef bowl with flat noodles and spicy cucumber side dish. The food came out relatively quickly and it came out piping hot (yessss). The broth was a 3.5/5, the meat was a 5/5 the noodles was a 4/5, cucumber was a solid 5/5. The broth was just okay flavorful... but the beef was wow. so soft and so flavorful. Really enjoyed the meal overall. 

We really enjoyed watching the noodle master hand pull the noodles. We sat at the bar so we had good viewing of him stretching, pulling, twirling, and cutting them. Time to time, he gave the whole store a scare with him throwing the heavy batch onto the counter top so be aware that randomly, you will hear a giant BANG repeatedly (not for long though!)

All in all, great place to stop by! definitely recommend it.",2,538
202,"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night.",1,202
448,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

72,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)",0,72
45,"I love the vibe of this place. It feels very local and cozy but also cool and hip. If you're coming for dinner, consider making a reservation, it gets busy!

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and there are so many options to choose from! I ordered the Campechano, carnitas and fish tacos. All were delicious and had a good kick to them - just what I look for in a good taco. If you're not so great with spice, ask the servers to take it easy on the spice sauce.

The real star of the meal were the corn tortillas. You can tell that they are made in-house and are oh so fresh!",2,45
277,"Got to finally try out the new location with a couple of friends and it's a really great place to go for a nice night out. The restaurant is beautiful, it was easy to get a reservation and the service is impeccable. Our server gave us great recommendations, was super helpful and we got our food in a timely fashion. 

Keep in mind it's more of a fine dining establishment so I found the dishes to be pricey for what we got but I thought it was worth it for a special occasion but not somewhere I'd go frequently. 

The most important part, the food, was delicious. Ordered the tuna tartare ($25) that came with guac as a starter and it was super fresh and tasted great. They also brought our bread in olive oil that was so good and soft that I could've finished the whole plate.

I ordered the spaghettini with shrimp ($30), which our server had said was one of their more popular dishes and it was SOOOO good. The shrimp with the flavourful tomato cream sauce was to die for. My husband got the pasta of the day, a truffle pasta, but thought it was a bit bland and at $40 way too $$$ for what it was. 

Definitely somewhere I'd recommend for a nice meal if you're okay to spend some $ as the food is great as well as the ambiance. You'll be in for a treat.",2,277
163,"Hospitality class should use this restaurant as an example! Food is really yums, and definitely fulfilled my cravings.

562,"This food was so ""yummy"", pun intended. We ordered the shrimp dumplings (steamed) and were not expecting them to be so full of flavor. A tiny, clean, hidden gem- pushed back from the hustle and bustle of the main road. Would highly recommend!",2,562

A quick perusal of Yelp led us to pick this spot. It's not much from the outside, but we were warmly greeted upon entering and quickly guided to a table.

Service was attentive even though we had a few language issues at first. Ordered margaritas (Tequila 1800 Reposado) and ordered our food. If you're in search of freshly prepared Mexican food that's authentic and well priced then you'll not go wrong here. This seems to be the spot for Mexican families (always a good sign!) and and our experience was delightful.",2,27

315,"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!",1,315
627,"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.",1,627
655,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity.",1,655
680,"Maybe I didn't know what to expect but the wings are served cool and are mostly skin and bone. Did not do it for me.

Mostly just noodles, a little sauce and some garnish.",0,680

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good.

Will go back...",1,600

Went at 6pm on a Wednesday night, no line-ups yet (when we left at 7pm there was a line-up of 8 people at the door).

Very family friendly place as well. Lots of parents bringing their newborn, hence why the noise level is quite loud. But the energy is great.",2,458
598,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0,598

647,"Let me update my most recent experience under the new ownership.  

I just had a way better experience here than the last time I came which should be noted.  The bbq pork and roast pork were very moist, full of flavour, and the portion was good.  For $7.50, I'd much rather get a lunchbox here, than... ahem... the neighbouring joints.  I like the soup here too.  

Service was quick.  They're back in my good books!",2,647
530,"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.

The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!",2,530
64,"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did.",1,64
293,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience.",0,293
356,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1,356
668,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods.",1,668
586,This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies.

252,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service.",1,252

You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense.

365,"Tip: check into the restaurant on Yelp for a free dessert! 

I ordered the pomodoro pasta which was a simple tomato sauce pasta cooked with olive oil and garlic. Flavour wise I thought it wasn't boring, which sometimes happens with simple tomato pastas, and quite tasty. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce coated the soaghetti noodles nicely. I think it's definitely worth trying for it's simple but rich flavour. Given the price you are paying for (~$9 for the dish) you're receiving a pretty big portion.

I also used the Yelp check in function and got free dessert! Friends and I ordered most of the offered desserts and I tried the white chocolate tiramisu and coconut cake. The tiramisu was very underwhelming, presentation and taste wise. Maybe because I was expecting a traditional tiramisu layered dessert but this was just lady fingers stacked onto each other with some cream. I'm not complaining as it was free dessert, but if you were to pay for it I don't think it'd be worth it. The coconut cake on the other hand was delicious! It is a very dense, moist, and strong coconut flavoured cake. A bit heavy, but good to share with others. I'd recommend this!",2,365

There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time.",1,629

I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving.

56,"Who doesn't love a good taco?

I surely do, so I was happy to meet my dining companion at Tacos El Asador, as authentic-sounding a taco joint as I've ever encountered in our fair city.

I decided to go with the Chorizo and the Birria (Goat) tacos, with the latter arriving first. I don't think I've ever eaten goat meat in the context, so I was definitely excited to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint. The meat was cooked perfectly and contained a very flavorful blend of spices, while the two sauces on the table, of which one is impressively hot, effectively enhance the taste of the concoction.

The Chorizo arrived next and while it too was quite good, it didn't blow me away like the first one. It tasted like virtually every other chorizo taco I've ever eaten; there weren't any unexpected flavors at work here, and in fact, the chorizo itself was a little bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the heck out of it, though, especially when I added those aforementioned sauces.

I also ordered a bowl of their Chicken, Black Beans and Tortilla Soup. I'm no tortilla soup expert, so it's entirely possible this was an above-average variation, but I wasn't impressed. The broth was salty without being flavorful, while the plentiful bits of tortilla got soggy immediately and gave the dish a rather unpleasant texture. I should note, too, that the soup comes with a fairly hefty amount of cheese, which definitely should have been indicated on the menu.",1,56
79,"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one.

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!",1,178

Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the ros√© sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!",1,394
467,"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.  

Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.   

Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh. 

Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought. 

Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had. 

Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. 

No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate.",1,467
657,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1,657
606,"I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room",1,606
197,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great .",0,197
572,"Fudao is a standard noodle house that gives really generous portions! 

I was actually expecting it to be more of a dipping noodle situation after seeing the photos but it's actually more of a hot pot since you're supposed to toss in all of the toppings and noodles in your broth immediately before it cools. 

For the price, I think it's a solid spot that will definitely fill you up. The service was just OK. I was surprised that there was a decent amount of seating. If you're visiting, it's not a must but if you're looking for a place to get a substantial amount of food for a good price it's worth trying.",1,572
618,"I come to Â∑ùÂë≥ËΩ© occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront. 

Once inside, it's the same familiar servers and that awful plaid carpet. The prices haven't changed much over the years and neither has the menu, although I did notice the portions are smaller. I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day. 

Tasty, good value and a viable option if you are willing to relax your standards of cleanliness.",1,618

479,"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good

General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables",1,479
21,"Wow, the most intense tacos I've ever had! Don't go expecting to have a sit down meal and please do yourself a favour and don't go on a date here because you will get messy. I promise you it's all worth it.

Wait in line and order at the cash, wait for your tacos and hope there's a seat. We were there at 3pm on a Saturday and we managed to squeeze in at the bar table. You can always take out but I think dining there is also part of the experience. 

The tacos are massive! I thought 2 wouldn't be enough but it was more than enough. They also have many different hot sauces you can add. Never have I eaten tacos with a fork but trust me, these are very big and I had to eat half the inside before I was able to somewhat grab them.

I believe they're opening a larger location across the street, I think it's much needed to keep up with the demand!",2,21
387,"i tried this place out on a week night for my birthday w.3 of my gfs. we ordered 4 pasta dishes and a charcuterie board to share. our server (short redish hair) didnt seem enthused all night..not sure if thats just how she was..but definitely not on the friendly side. she seem quite hostel towards us than the other server we saw.. but we made our own night fun w.each other! 
service 3/5.

the salami charcuterie board was ok..nothing in particular wowed us with it. she brought it out and dropped it on our table. no explaination as to what was what..didnt know which salami/cured meat was which..didnt even know which cheese selection they had given us either.. it wouldve been nice to know what we were feasting on..i know my friend requested more salami and a cheese that wasnt so strong. i think they gave us brie cheese..

we then got the 4 pastas: orecchiette, bolognese, pappardelle & carbonara.
all of it was really good! forgot to ask for the pastas to be cooked a little more well but the flavours are nice.
braised rabbit was tender. fennel sausage had a nice kick. bolognese meat sauce was delicious carbonara wasnt overly creamy.

overall food 4/5.

atmosphere was nice. dim lit, cute little lights hung through out. lots of seating and tables throughout the place. not sure how busy it would be on a weekend..but id love to come back and try their pizzas!",1,387

The wontons are so good. I tried the shrimp and ordered one piece of the pork wonton to try. They both were amazing!  I'm so cautious to order dumplings because they look/taste like mystery meat but not here. These dumplings are so tasty and good quality filling.",2,590
579,"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships.",0,579
576,"I love going to Fudao Noodle House to get my fix for Crossing the Bridge noodles. They have a good variety of broths that you can choose from and they range in spice level. My favourite broths are the Thai Curry and the Spicy and Sour. 

For those of you who aren't familiar with Crossing the Bridge noodles, you get the broth in this burning hot stone pot separate from 10 different toppings and the noodles which are unlimited refills, and c'mon, who can say no to that? You put the rolls of meat they give you or you can order extra toppings into your broth like slices of pork, lamb or beef, or even beef/fish balls. Then you put the rest of the toppings in there, the noodles and voila! 

I haven't come by in a while and I came when it was relatively steady but the service was still on point. They've refilled my water and asked if everything was okay ever so often. I also have a shellfish sensitivity so I don't add the shrimp they provide as an extra topping, but when I went on my last visit, they offered to swap it for another ingredient I could eat. It was great customer service and something I don't really see other places that offer Crossing the Bridge noodles doing. 

Overall, really great service and yummy food that is decently priced!",2,576
528,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1,528
441,"Not authentic!! It's a good sandwich with good fillings. The bread however, is what makes a Banh mi a Banh mi and it was too soggy. Really good Banh mi bread is just perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is not it. The fries were okay as well. Also too soggy. Sigh.",1,441

140,"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0,140
402,"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too.",1,402
285,"This place is pretty much the definition of a hole in the wall (which full disclosure is in my opinion the best type of restaurant). It's dark and tiny and has very intimate and authentic vibe. 

We started with the meatballs appetizer and those things were melt in your mouth amazing. The marinara was so rich and flavourful we were ecstatic when the server dropped off some bread so we could soak up every last bit of it. 

We opted to share a couple things since neither of us had been there before:

The Bolognese Rigatoni and the Diavolo Pizza. Both were great but the real standout was the Rigatoni. We both heavily favoured it. The sauce was rich and hearty the pasta perfectly al dente, there was absolutely nothing lacking in this dish. 

The only down downside to our experience here was we did have to wait with dirty dishes on our table (which is my biggest restaurant pet peeve) for about 15 minutes after we had finished eating to get our bill. Normally this would really bother me but the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food really made this place enjoyable.

We look forward to coming back.",2,285
44,"Campechano Taqueria is tucked away inconspicuously at the corner of Adelaide/Portland. Inside you'll find a quiet, mellow and hip taqueria that makes for a great date spot or catch-up dinner with friends. I'd say that Campechano is distinct from other popular taquerias nearby such as Wilbur and Mi Taco in that it is a lot more of a sit-down place and not so much a take-out or eat-and-go type of place, so if you're looking for more of that vibe, Campechano is definitely for you.

Campechano's tacos are noticeably pricier than other taquieras nearby, and although tasty, I honestly found it hard to justify the extra cost. My buddy and I went for a taco crawl and we went to the two aforementioned taquerias and we both agreed that Campechano's tacos left quite a bit to be desired as the last taqueria in our crawl. Although most of the tacos come with avocado, which is often a premium ingredient, the meats were a bit too salty for our taste. I would even say that the barbacoa, made with braised lamb, was a little bit too chewey for my liking. Nonetheless, Campechano serves delicious tacos and provides a unique atmosphere and dining experience so it is definitely worth going to.",2,44
345,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere.",1,345

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something.",1,589
574,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1,574

558,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable.",0,558

Perfect because not only it is delicious and comforting, but it won't leave you feeling gross. I had plans too go ever since they were on Queen Street, but then they moved and still made it a point of visiting. Went with a friend who lived in Milan for a while, and she also loved it. we ordered two different kinds and shared it, which I recommend doing since the pasta is heavy and you may want to change up your palate. We ordered the pizzoccheri di teglio and the casoncelli alla bergamasca, and nothing was left on our plates by the end of it. A plus was the adorable deCor that made the restaurant feel cozy yet super elegant. Highly recommend checking out this spot for authentic Northern Italian cuisine!",2,256

That was okay though because when you walk inside, the ambiance is very neat with a modern Mediterranean flare to it. We were seated on the downstairs level but we quickly realized that they have a massive upstairs area with a full bar and tables that accommodate larger groups. We were okay with being downstairs though because it was a bit quieter. 

Usually we a bottle of wine kind of couple but their cocktails sounded incredible so we decided to only do those. SO MANY OPTIONS. All very unique from what goes in the drink to the final presentation. I wish I knew the name of the one drink I had because it was delicious. I really enjoyed their spiced G&T as well. You can tell the bartender's put a lot of work and thought into these drinks.

For dinner, they suggest about 4-5 items because their menu is meant to be shared family style. After a lot of help from our server who was excellent in giving recommendations, we decided to order the turkish manti dumplings, black truffle wood fired pide, short rib kebab and a side of their roasted brussels sprouts. They did a great job timing these items out so they came out one by one so when we finished one plate, the next one was on its way to our table. Everything was fantastic but if you were only going to order one thing from this menu, it would have to be the dumplings. THEY WERE INCREDIBLE. The sauce they came in were so good we actually dunked out pide into the dish as well. 

We were very happy to come across this place and would recommend it to anyone that was looking for a great date night option or just getting together with friends, they have something for everyone.",2,447
392,"Donatello's has a great decor and great atmosphere. The staff were extraordinarily attentive and friendly. The cost/performance ratio of the food is however a little wanting. I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back.",1,392

78,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.",1,78
585,"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?""",1,585
504,"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!

Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and saut√©ed green beans.

As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the saut√©ed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy. 

Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!",1,504
186,"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were √ºber nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food.",1,186
397,"The service was really great. It was a busy dinner rush, but the servers were all very attentive and super friendly. The food was delicious! Highly recommend the Polipo e Patate ( grilled octopus and potatoes) and the Involtini De Melanzane (eggplant). The eggplant was so tasty and the tomatoes sauce was phenomenal! So simple but bursting with flavour. Ask for extra bread to dip in the sauce. The octopus was so tender and well cooked. The potatoes under were crispy and had a lemony flavour that complimented the dish so well. I got the oltraggioso pizza - the dough was perfect. Crispy on the outside, so nicely thin and chewy crust. The flavour of the pizza itself was good but add on some of the peperoncino oil, amazing! The pappardelle was also really good. Pasta was perfect, chewy with a nice bite and the sauce was so flavorful. It's a bit of a tight space so when it's busy, it is a bit loud so think more lively restaurant, rather than quiet ambiance.",2,397
545,"Nice staff
Simple interior
About $20 for king pao w rice; restaurants love to add $$$$ for the rice, they know it goes with rice, so charge more, seems unfair.
It is definitely hot. Felt like CRAP hour(s) later.
Hard on the stomach, I like hot, this was too greasy and doesn't sit well.
Did I mention 4 hrs later..
Not so good!
Bad aftertaste and guts are mad at me.",0,545
310,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.",0,310
423,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians",1,423
548,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!",1,548
339,"My review is for Uber eats delivery from Grazie.
We ordered 2 pizzas-1 classic margarita and one mushroom. Both pizzas were stone cold and were undercooked. It tasted kind of like frozen pizza you can get from a supermarket.

287,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it.",0,287
263,"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple.",1,263
16,"Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a ""large chicken burrito"" which cost 14$. I got a really authentic vibe when I walked in. However, the burrito was one of the cheapest ones I've ever eaten. I asked for guacamole.... no guacamole. It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality. All flavours were very bland. Extremely disappointing, for $14 I expect at minimum good size/quantity but didn't even get that.",0,16
434,"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater.",1,434
379,"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

Love the drink list: wine, beer, cocktails. A great place to have a drink with snacks. 

We seated by the bar area, so one of the bartenders was serving us. We were checked on frequently and the service was attentive.

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area.",1,379
138,"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north.",1,138
377,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca",0,377
193,"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!",0,193
581,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions.",0,581
332,"Went there on Dec. 31st at lunchtime and lineup was ridiculously long. We had to wait two hours before we were able to sit down. Having said that, I would say that the wait is worth it, as the pasta is really at a whole another level, better than any other place I've tried in Toronto (and even Italy as a matter of fact). 

We had the tagliatelle with the ragu sauce and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with the blanco sauce (with truffle and parmagiano cheese). Both dishes were amazing, however, the true outstanding item on their menu that day was the Fior Di Latte: the mozzarella ball was prepared in the morning of the same day. We also ordered the Parma ham appetizer (cured in house for 16 months), which was also good, but nothing to write home for...

All in all, I highly recommend this place, but just  don't go hungry, as you will have to wait for a long time (There is only sitting room for 10 people inside). My only complaint about this place is their opening hours, they are only open for lunch four days a week (and sadly, they are not open on the werk",2,332
409,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area.",1,409
288,"Trattoria taverniti is a little place in Little Italy downtown. Staff are very nice and the decorations are very homie. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta is uncooked but that's how it is served but it was very good ! The flavor was good the sauce was just right and there was lots of meat in it! My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was a bit salty for him and it was uncooked a bit. The Quattro formaggi was good and very cheesy and oil ! 
The only bad thing was the service it was very very slow. My friend finished his food before us and we had to wait about another 15-20 mins for our dishes to come. Also asking for water took a while to get their attention because they were all zooming by the tables. 

Overall though the food here is quite good but a little pricey",1,288
230,"The first thing that'll happen when you arrive (after a tiny struggle to find this place cus it's in the corner where the main entrance is) is that you'll be greeted by the nicest lady everrrrr! You can order at the counter for takeout or have a seat by the windows and she'll come over to take you order.

We ordered the alfredo pasta and a pizza. Pizza was a thin flatbread style pizza topped with some cheapo cheese. The alfredo pasta was a good size for the price but really tasted like nothing special. Pasta wasn't homemade and the sauce was pretty average. 

Service over Food here!",1,230

I'll be back.",2,11
333,"Famiglia Baldassarre is located on Geary around Dovercourt/Dupont. It is hidden in an industrial area and has been one of the most talked about places in Toronto for pasta! They also supply the pasta for a lot of Toronto's top restaurants and chefs. Only downside is that they are only open from Tues to Fri from 12pm to around 2pm for lunch. You can also buy their fresh pasta as well to make at home. I finally had a chance to try Famiglia Baldassarre on my day off.

Famiglia Baldassarre has a small space for eating in (4 tables, 10 chairs); I shared a table as I had come alone. What's great about the space is that you can also watch the staff busily making pasta and other delicious items. The changing menu is posted on a blackboard and uploaded to their IG stories. Usually there are 2 kinds of pasta dishes and a variety of smaller dishes (beets, burrata, etc.), as well as drinks.

I arrived at Famiglia Baldassarre on a Wednesday morning at around 11:15am where I was the 2nd in line (did not have to wait). How it works is that you order at the counter before finding a seat. The sign at the door states that you must order before finding a seat so that you don't bud the line or hold up a table. That day, I ordered the cavatelli with rapini and anchovies. I also ordered some fresh burrata cheese. The burrata cheese was to die for - very fresh and delicious with the free bread that they provide. The only thing missing was a glass of wine! The pasta itself was super fresh, al dente and had a good texture. The sauce was not heavy and it coated the cavatelli well. 

Overall, friendly staff and delicious food. If I ever have the chance to have a day off again, definitely would line up for Famiglia Baldassarre again!",2,333

I came here just to check out what they had to offer and ordered some small treats and a few bottles of milk to go. 

This place is very packed on weekends, so plan accordingly. They have everything from fresh pastas, to different varieties of cheese, pizza, and desserts. I bought a bottle of whole milk and egg nog (about $5 each for 1L). 

I ordered a cannoli that was freshly made and was quite satisfied!",2,354
122,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,",1,122
544,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt.",0,544
223,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.",0,223

The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving.",1,90

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo.",1,255
87,"La Carnita is one hip taco joint in the heart of the downtown core. We were a party of five on a Friday night so we had reserved our seats in advance. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and really gave us useful insights and advice of what to order.

We ordered the tortilla chips with all three dips to give some variety to our table. The corn salsa was my absolute favourite. They were all quite delicious though. The corn salsa stood out because it was sweet, tangy, and aromatic. It just paired so finely with the chips. Next, we started ordering our tacos.

As per recommended by our server, I got the In Cod We Trust and the Pollo Frito tacos to start. Each tacos was about the size of your hand and was loaded with a sizeable protein and veggie. The Pollo Frito stood out for me because of its slight crunch and exploding flavour from the peanut lime sauce. The cod taco was an interesting combination. I liked the flaky texture of the fish and the fresh vegetables. These tacos really impressed me so I ordered the Carne Asada taco to finish. The steak had an intoxicating smoky flavour which I really liked. 

I had to grab some churros in the end to really tie my meal together. They gave me 3 huge churros along with a sweet dip. Really loved the crispy exterior and tender centre.

Super happy I tried this place out. It is such a great place to dine in on a casual outing!",2,87

Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",1,262
444,"The food and cocktails were exceptional. Truly. We tried the ahi tuna, beets with labneh, black truffle rice, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, marcona almonds and olives. All delicious and beautiful.  

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein.",1,444
110,"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh.",1,110

15,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place.",0,15
142,"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown.",0,142
218,"Came here with a few friends for dinner, we had a reservation. The high ceilings and ambient lighting make for a beautiful dining experience!

I ordered the SCIALATIELLI (don't ask me to pronounce this because I have no idea) as I can't have tomato-based pasta and this white pasta was recommended by the server. Of course, portion sizes are on the smaller side but the dish was very rich. We didn't order any appetizers but next time I come back I would definitely recommend sharing an appetizer in addition to the main, as I left a little bit hungry.

We also ordered a bottle of red wine to share, needles to say they only have Italian wines in their selection. 

Overall, it was a great experience to dine here with friends, we spent almost 4 HOURS here talking and having a great time! A part of that was because the server never came to check on us and we actually had to flag them down when we wanted to leave. Oh well!",2,218
608,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again .",0,608
207,"Fresh fish, quality pasta and an above average cup of espresso make this livley Italian restaraunt the place to be if you are near the core. 

We arrived as a group of six and were quickly seated.  The service was up to standard for the area; quick, consistent and attentive.  As a side note, the gratuity for a group that size is included.

The layout of high ceiling, exposed brick walls and an open-concept kitchen is fun (if not overplayed ).  At 
1:00pm the restaraunt seemed to be packed with young professionals catching up with old friends.  It's lively and a little loud (in a good way).

We shared a number of dishes.  I tried the Mafalde Funghi pasta (mushrooms), a Margarita Pizza, a Branzino (fish and oh so good) and the Cavolo Nero salad. The food ranged from good to excellent.

The salad was remarkably refreshing and had a good balance of flavours.  The pasta was savory and filling and the pizza was above average if not amazing.

The Branzino looked to be grilled with some olive oil and served on a small bed of veggies.  It was nice and simple.

For dessert I had cannoli and a double espresso.   The coffee was rich and had a distinct flavour (befitting of any self-respecting Italian restaurant).  The cannoli could have been better.  The cream cheese filling just doesn't measure up to the rest of the meal. 

Will definately come back to Gusto next time I am in the area or to catch up with an old friend.",2,207
227,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.",1,227

Impeccable service as always.",2,351

614,"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning.",1,614

661,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that.",1,661
271,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh.",1,271
659,"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!",1,659
487,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0,487
372,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server.",1,372

671,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian.",1,320
317,"Went for the 4-6 aperitivo where you get a token to fill a small plate with food for every alcoholic beverage you order. Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given.",1,317

The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant.",0,269

BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good. 

First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.  

The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances.",1,613

664,"I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to try North-West Chinese eats that are different from usual westernized Chinese food (aka fried rice, General Tao, etc.)

My first impression was the interior - very bright and modern with transparent glass stools, unlike other typical Chinese restaurants that run on a warm and cozy vibe. Even though the restaurant looked spacious from outside, it was actually quite tight with limited seats. 

Since it was our first visit, we opted for the restaurant's bestsellers, which were beef Yopo BiangBiang (wide flat noodles) and Pork JiaMo (pork bun). The noodles arrived quickly after 5 minutes with tomato scrambled egg, braised beef, and assortments of vegetables (cubed potatoes, carrots, ear fungus, edamame, zucchini). At first, I thought the combination of ingredients was peculiar; however, it turned out to be absolutely delicious as different flavors really complimented each other. I also enjoyed their chewy ""ribbon noodles""! If you are not able to handle spicy food like I am, I'd recommend asking the waitress for no (or less) chilli flakes since they really added some intense heat to the dish. The pork JiaMo was good as well - the shredded meat was well-marinated. 

We visited a few days after Grand Opening and the restaurant was quite packed. However, service was still quick and efficient. 

A bonus point is that Artisan Plus is vegan-friendly!

I'd love to come back to try other different North-Western Chinese food!",2,664

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche.

I ordered the beer-battered fish taco option that was a little pricier for only one taco, as well as the grilled fish taco option that came with two for a lesser price. All were so amazing; just spot on with the authentic flavours and perfect cook. The servers are super smiley and knowledgeable about the menu.

The food was amazing! I went with the Calamarata Con Gamberi dish which was to die for. It included ""wild shrimp, tomato sauce, cherry tomato, chillies, marjoram and parsley."" It was spicy but had just the right amount without overdoing it. My friend went with the Mafalde Al Funghi which is one of the pasta dishes that Nervosa is well known for. This dish included ""portobello, porcini, crimini, oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, truffle paste and light cream sauce."" I also got a bite of hers and despite hating mushroom, it was delicious. We also got the Bruschetta Al Funghi, which again included mushrooms but was nonetheless tasty. I've actually never had bruschetta prepared with mushrooms replaced by tomatoes, but I'd order it again. 

To drink we got the Must Be Nice & Diablo cocktails, both of which were so good. None overly sweet which is usually my number one issue with cocktails. 

The service was superb! All the waiters that served us were friendly and attentive. Our food took probably a bit over 10 minutes to come which was great, considering the restaurant was packed and it was a Saturday night. Even the wait to be seated initially went by fast.

The tacos were smaller than other taco joints, but they are cheaper in price ($3.75 vs. $5-8). The tortilla was thin and soft yet it was still able to hold the filling/topping.

In terms of flavours and the protein, I didn't find it too memorable. The beef shank was a bit dry but the haddock was freshly fried.

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out.

509,"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some.

It's actually a little hard to get to where you want to go because of how narrow the aisles are. If people are in browsing mode in front of you there isn't much you can do about it, especially in the main arteries. 

The marketplace style means that there are different stalls that sell different goods - an area for breads, seafood, fresh produce, etc. There are also some stalls with ready to eat food like Roman-style pizza, gelato, coffee, and desserts. Eataly also boasts three of its own restaurants. La Pizza & La Pasta seemed to be the most popular with people taking up all the spaces in the waiting area and long lines just to get a number on the reservation list. La Pescheria, which is their seafood restaurant, had open seating at lunch so if the wait is too long at the other restaurants you can always come here. 

Eataly spans a few floors and is a separate entrance from the Manulife Centre. There are escalators and one elevator that can move you between floors. There are restrooms located on the main level of the Eataly.",2,353
422,"My outlook improved when the burrata ($30) was set on the table. The cheese draped with thin slices of salty prosciutto, why mess with a great combination? 

Since the bread wasn't toasted or oiled, it was a bit chewy and difficult to get a knife through, so if it was cut thinner it would be even better. The caramelized onion and fig spread on the bread was absolutely delicious and went so nicely with the milky flavourful cheese, which was served at a perfect room temperature. The staggering $30 price tag was a bit of a surprise though... note to self, always ask for prices with specials.  

Well marbled beef was used in the carne cruda di chianina ($19) and while I couldn't taste the fried garlic mentioned on the menu, the anchovy was an interesting addition to the mix. We're asked if we'd like a side of bread ($3) which, in my opinion, is a must. You really need something to spread the beef tartare on or it'd be way too salty and overpowering on its own. For those that are abstaining from carbs, perhaps a salad would help balance the flavourful beef.

Even one of Giulietta's pizzas would be a great shared starter. The l'amentea ($21) has a healthy portion of spicy soppressata and tons of garlic that would give Count Dracula a scare. I love garlic so found it went nicely with the soppressata, but did drown out the fior di latte, which became more for its creamy chewy texture than flavour. The well blistered crust was coloured evenly and had a lovely chewy texture, but could be thicker in the middle as the paper-thin centre became lost amongst the sauce.",2,422
670,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1,670
125,"Absolutely amazing! Two overflowing tacos for $5. 
Made fresh right in front of you and worth the wait. 
I had one chorizo & one steak. The steak was a bit bland but the chorizo was ridiculously good. 
I'll be back for sure.",2,125
418,"This restaurant is now on the top 10 list for the best restaurants in Canada.  I came here before the list came out and I have to say I am extremely underwhelmed.  There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun.  But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places.  For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again.  I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don't like walnut that much.  

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing.  There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.  I have NO idea how this restaurant made it to the top restaurant list in Canada and I will not be coming back again.  I am giving 3 stars because the service is FANtastic and the restaurant is beautiful.",1,418
179,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0,179
165,"Quetzal is interesting. There's this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there's a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. 

The food though, for Mexican just wasn't as great as the rest of the restaurant itself. Things were plated prettily (maybe a bit oddly), but nothing popped our taste buds as Mexican flavours should. It was just an okay meal. We left a bit hungry and wanting more.",1,165
121,"Gem of a find. 
My brother had this bookmarked since we landed in Toronto and we finally came here for lunch today. So pleased we did!
Ordered:
(Food)
Taste of Mexico platter - amazing value (good size) and the perfect way to try different things. We found the chorizo too salty for our taste, but everything else was fantastic. Pastor and grilled pineapple combination were excellent together, carne Asada was perfectly cooked. The guacamole was excellent too
Barbacoa taco - definitely a favorite we'll order again
Pastor taco - great but didn't realize we had pastor in the platter too, so an accidental repeat
Mexican street corn - can't go wrong with this
(Dessert)
Diablito - a must order!! Ended the meal on the perfect note with this dessert. Probably our favorite dish, beautifully put together
Churros - also great and freshly made

Overall, we had a wonderful meal for a reasonable price. Fantastic service, great food.
Only note - cleaning the hot sauce bottles before serving would be a good idea, as they look less than tempting. And we found the suicide sauce totally weak, but we eat a lot of spice in our house!",2,121
431,"My friend recommended this place. I was a bit skeptical at first, since I just went to San Diego not long ago and ate a lot of good tacos. I gave it a shot when my boyfriend and I passed by Kensington market. Although a bit iffy at the $6 price, we decided the line was a good indicator that the tacos were good.

This place is cash only, and we waited in line for 20 minutes or so. The line moves fairly quickly. We got the fish taco and one of the shrimp tacos - the fish taco was definitely the best I've had. The shrimp one was also good, but not as good as the fish taco.

Really wish we ordered more!",2,431
361,"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.",0,361
493,"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point.",1,493
266,"I love the risotto here. Pricey and there's extra wait time for it, but so creamy and cheesy and delicious.  The rabbit is also delish but I find the portion size a bit small (I could eat two portions both because of the taste and because of the size).  This place is perfect for a date night as it's very small and intimate despite its location which is in the middle of Queen Street busy-ness. This place is northern Italian as opposed to most Italian restaurants you come across, and the Italian I was with said that next time we should bring his Nonna. If that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.",2,266
26,"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill.",0,26
148,"Good Eats can be that simple and I love how Xola Mexican Food prepares their food. Fresh ingredients and with a touch of love, herbs and spices, Mexican Food is just that simple.

The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.

We shared: 

Horchata ($3.50)
- I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred
- maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!

Burrito Lamb ($8.95)
- slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour

Fish Taco ($15)
- fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy!
- love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!

Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!",2,148
100,"Had a nice Friday dinner upstairs (this place has 2 levels, bottom is more bar styled). We ordered the tequila flight

 Tromba Family: Blanco + Reposado + Anejo $13

 Comes with 3 tequilas and spiced orange and lime to start. It came in a cool looking plank board and shots served in dip cups. Very unique. 

I ordered the pork belly to start (my favourite dish of the night- belly was fatty and crispy)

, shrimp tacos (delicate but full of taste) Camar√≥n Picante - Spicy Butterflied Shrimp

citrus mayo + cucumber + pico + corn + radish + pickled onion + jalape√±o $7

 and the flank steak plate: CARNE ASADA - GRILLED FLANK STEAK(chimichurri + creamy Mexican street corn + queso fresco + blue corn chips) $23

 All the food was great, the hot sauce comes with big punches. There's also a lot of specials during the week so we will be coming back for more ! There is also a hot sauce challenge...if you're into that crazy life definitely check this place out !",2,100
238,This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.,0,238

I've tried the other Levetto locations before and decided to come back to this particular location as I was in the mood for pasta. I dropped by for lunch on a Thursday; the eatery was quite empty. The pasta I ordered was filing and service was friendly but the food was just forgettable this particular time. I found the pasta to be underwhelming, under seasoned, and overcooked. Unfortunately did not have a good experience here and will not be returning.",1,366
534,"LUNCH

Just finished eating Rasta Pasta and was walking by, when my eyes caught wind if the giant JUICY DUMPLiNG logo. 

I remember bookmarking this place for quite a while now and what true yelper can walk by a bookmarked place and not try it? Not one!

This place is the McDonald's of dumplings! Its fast, affordable and delicious! 

So glad my eyes convinced my stomach to try it out. I ordered the soup filled pork dumplings and it was honestly as good as the dumplings I've had at DTF in Shanghai. 

You guys gotta try for yourself, but imo dont order ubereats or foodora, you have to try it straight outta the steamer to get the real real, and that can only be accomplished in person! ;)",2,534
280,"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment.",0,280
158,"This is the best Mexican food that we have experienced outside of Mexico (where we live 5 months of the year). Not only is the food fantastic, but this establishment 'gives back' to the community through their efforts at helping underprviledged people and families through their foodbank initiatives.

We actually passed this place after dinner but the low price of the soup dumplings was too hard to pass by. I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dumplings. There was ample soup  within the dumplings, and you could get the soy sauce/vinegar on your  own. Well worth a late night trip  here!",2,532

Cant wait to try their other food when I visit.",2,92

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

459,"Covid era ritual pick up order.  I would recommend ordering ahead through the phone or app bc often times there is a line out the door and the last thing u want to do is wait to order and also wait to pick up. The line can get long to pick up the order bc u r waiting in the same line as food delivery workers and it becomes quite unpleasant when the weather gets too cold and windy or rainy.  I noticed there is a price difference between lunch and dinner orders of the same thing. 

Pad see ew is what i only ever get a Thai restaurants. It's probably a solid B, better than most places but not the best I ever had due to it somewhat lacking in taste. 

I added a combo thing to my order which comes with a fresh spring roll which was good and a Tom yam? soup which I tried for the first time and can't say it's for me bc it's spicy and sour. 

Overall, the prices here seem to be on the higher side of Thai restaurants in the area. I would order again on ritual for lunch only.",2,459
330,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return.",0,330
578,"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took.",0,578

Service: 4.5/5
Value: 4.5/5
Ambience:4.5/5

That said, with the equivalent of a glass of wine per person and a bottle of Prosecco, appetizers, mains, desert and tip the total bill came to 138$ per person which was reasonable for fine dining. If this place offers corkage, I can see ourselves returning.",2,276
483,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1,483
